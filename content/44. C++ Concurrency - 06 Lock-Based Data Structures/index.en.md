# Chapter 6: Designing lock-based concurrent data structures

Designing lock-based
concurrent data structures

This chapter covers

- What it means to design data structures for

concurrency

- Guidelines for doing so
- Example implementations of data structures

designed for concurrency

In the last chapter we looked at the low-level details of atomic operations and the
memory model. In this chapter we’ll take a break from the low-level details (although
we’ll need them for chapter 7) and think about data structures.

 The choice of data structure to use for a programming problem can be a key
part of the overall solution, and parallel programming problems are no exception.
If a data structure is to be accessed from multiple threads, either it must be completely immutable so the data never changes and no synchronization is necessary,
or  the  program  must  be  designed  to  ensure  that  changes  are  correctly  synchronized between threads. One option is to use a separate mutex and external locking
to  protect  the  data,  using  the  techniques  we  looked  at  in  chapters  3  and  4,  and
another is to design the data structure itself for concurrent access.

 When designing a data structure for concurrency, you can use the basic building
blocks of multithreaded applications from earlier chapters, such as mutexes and condition  variables.  Indeed,  you’ve  already  seen  a  couple  of  examples  showing  how  to
combine  these  building  blocks  to  write  data  structures  that  are  safe  for  concurrent
access from multiple threads.

 In this chapter we’ll start by looking at some general guidelines for designing data
structures for concurrency. We’ll then take the basic building blocks of locks and condition variables and revisit the design of those basic data structures before moving on
to more complex data structures. In chapter 7 we’ll look at how to go right back to
basics and use the atomic operations described in chapter 5 to build data structures
without locks.

 So, without further ado, let’s look at what’s involved in designing a data structure

for concurrency.

## 6.1 What does it mean to design for concurrency?

At  the  basic  level,  designing  a  data  structure  for  concurrency  means  that  multiple
threads can access the data structure concurrently, either performing the same or distinct operations, and each thread will see a self-consistent view of the data structure.
No data will be lost or corrupted, all invariants will be upheld, and there’ll be no problematic race conditions. This data structure is said to be thread-safe. In general, a data
structure will be safe only for particular types of concurrent access. It may be possible
to have multiple threads performing one type of operation on the data structure concurrently,  whereas  another  operation  requires  exclusive  access  by  a  single  thread.
Alternatively,  it  may  be  safe  for  multiple  threads  to  access  a  data  structure  concurrently if they’re performing different actions, whereas multiple threads performing the
same action would be problematic.

 Truly designing for concurrency means more than that, though: it means providing the opportunity for concurrency to threads accessing the data structure. By its nature,
a mutex provides mutual exclusion: only one thread can acquire a lock on the mutex at
a  time.  A  mutex  protects  a  data  structure  by  explicitly  preventing  true  concurrent
access to the data it protects.

 This is called serialization: threads take turns accessing the data protected by the
mutex; they must access it serially rather than concurrently. Consequently, you must
put careful thought into the design of the data structure to enable true concurrent
access. Some data structures have more scope for true concurrency than others, but in
all cases the idea is the same: the smaller the protected region, the fewer operations
are serialized, and the greater the potential for concurrency.

 Before we look at some data structure designs, let’s have a quick look at some simple guidelines for what to consider when designing for concurrency.

What does it mean to design for concurrency?

### 6.1.1 Guidelines for designing data structures for concurrency

As I mentioned, you have two aspects to consider when designing data structures for
concurrent access: ensuring that the accesses are safe and enabling genuine concurrent
access.  I  covered  the  basics  of  how  to  make  the  data  structure  thread-safe  back  in

- Ensure that no thread can see a state where the invariants of the data structure

have been broken by the actions of another thread.

- Take care to avoid race conditions inherent in the interface to the data structure
by providing functions for complete operations rather than for operation steps.
- Pay attention to how the data structure behaves in the presence of exceptions to

ensure that the invariants are not broken.

- Minimize  the  opportunities  for  deadlock  when  using  the  data  structure  by

restricting the scope of locks and avoiding nested locks where possible.

Before  you  think  about  any  of  these  details,  it’s  also  important  to  think  about  what
constraints you want to put on the users of the data structure; if one thread is accessing the data structure through a particular function, which functions are safe to call
from other threads?

  This  is  a  crucial  question  to  consider.  Generally,  constructors  and  destructors
require  exclusive  access  to  the  data  structure,  but  it’s  up  to  the  user  to  ensure  that
they’re not accessed before construction is complete or after destruction has started.
If the data structure supports assignment, swap(), or copy construction, then as the
designer of the data structure, you need to decide whether these operations are safe
to call concurrently with other operations or whether they require the user to ensure
exclusive  access  even  though  the  majority  of  functions  for  manipulating  the  data
structure may be called from multiple threads concurrently without any problems.

  The  second  aspect  to  consider  is  that  of  enabling  genuine  concurrent  access.  I
can’t offer much in the way of guidelines for this; instead, here’s a list of questions to
ask yourself as the data structure designer:

- Can the scope of locks be restricted to allow some parts of an operation to be

performed outside the lock?

- Can different parts of the data structure be protected with different mutexes?
- Do all operations require the same level of protection?
- Can a simple change to the data structure improve the opportunities for concurrency without affecting the operational semantics?

All these questions are guided by a single idea: how can you minimize the amount of
serialization that must occur and enable the greatest amount of true concurrency?
It’s  not  uncommon  for  data  structures  to  allow  concurrent  access  from  multiple
threads that merely read the data structure, whereas a thread that can modify the
data structure must have exclusive access. This is supported by using constructs like

std::shared_mutex.  Likewise,  as  you’ll  see  shortly,  it’s  quite  common  for  a  data
structure to support concurrent access from threads performing different operations
while serializing threads that try to perform the same operation.

 The simplest thread-safe data structures typically use mutexes and locks to protect
the data. Although there are issues with this, as you saw in chapter 3, it’s relatively easy
to ensure that only one thread is accessing the data structure at a time. To ease you
into the design of thread-safe data structures, we’ll stick to looking at such lock-based
data structures in this chapter and leave the design of concurrent data structures without locks for chapter 7.

## 6.2 Lock-based concurrent data structures

The design of lock-based concurrent data structures is all about ensuring that the
right mutex is locked when accessing the data and that the lock is held for the minimum amount of time. This is hard enough when there’s just one mutex protecting
a data structure. You need to ensure that data can’t be accessed outside the protection of the mutex lock and that there are no race conditions inherent in the interface, as you saw in chapter 3. If you use separate mutexes to protect separate parts
of the data structure, these issues are compounded, and there’s now also the possibility  of  deadlock  if  the  operations  on  the  data  structure  require  more  than  one
mutex to be locked. You therefore need to consider the design of a data structure
with multiple mutexes even more carefully than the design of a data structure with a
single mutex.

 In this section you’ll apply the guidelines from section 6.1.1 to the design of several simple data structures, using mutexes and locks to protect the data. In each case
you’ll seek out opportunities for enabling greater concurrency while ensuring that the
data structure remains thread-safe.

 Let’s start by looking at the stack implementation from chapter 3; it’s one of the
simplest data structures around, and it uses only a single mutex. Is it thread-safe? How
does it fare from the point of view of achieving true concurrency?

### 6.2.1 A thread-safe stack using locks

The thread-safe stack from chapter 3 is reproduced in the following listing. The intent
is to write a thread-safe data structure akin to std::stack<>, which supports pushing
data items onto the stack and popping them off again.

Listing 6.1 A class definition for a thread-safe stack

```cpp
#include <exception>
struct empty_stack: std::exception
{
    const char* what() const throw();
```

};
```cpp
template<typename T>
class threadsafe_stack
```

```cpp
    std::stack<T> data;
    mutable std::mutex m;
```

public:
```cpp
    threadsafe_stack(){}
    threadsafe_stack(const threadsafe_stack& other)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(other.m);
        data=other.data;
    }
    threadsafe_stack& operator=(const threadsafe_stack&) = delete;
    void push(T new_value)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m);
        data.push(std::move(new_value));
    }
    std::shared_ptr<T> pop()
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m);
        if(data.empty()) throw empty_stack();
        std::shared_ptr<T> const res(
           std::make_shared<T>(std::move(data.top())));
        data.pop();
        return res;
    }
    void pop(T& value)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m);
        if(data.empty()) throw empty_stack();
        value=std::move(data.top());
        data.pop();
    }
    bool empty() const
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m);
        return data.empty();
    }
```

};

Let’s look at each of the guidelines in turn and see how they apply here.

 First, as you can see, the basic thread safety is provided by protecting each member
function with a lock on the mutex, m. This ensures that only one thread is accessing
the data at any one time, so provided each member function maintains the invariants,
no thread can see a broken invariant.

 Second, there’s a potential for a race condition between empty() and either of the
pop() functions, but because the code explicitly checks for the contained stack being
empty  while  holding  the  lock  in  pop(),  this  race  condition  isn’t  problematic.  By
returning the popped data item directly as part of the call to pop(), you avoid a potential  race  condition  that  would  be  present  with  separate  top()  and  pop()  member
functions such as those in std::stack<>.

 Next, there are a few potential sources of exceptions. Locking a mutex may throw
an exception, but not only is this likely to be exceedingly rare (because it indicates a
problem with the mutex or a lack of system resources), it’s also the first operation in
each member function. Because no data has been modified, this is safe. Unlocking a
mutex can’t fail, so that’s always safe, and the use of std::lock_guard<> ensures that
the mutex is never left locked.

 The call to data.push() B may throw an exception if either copying/moving the
data value throws an exception or not enough memory can be allocated to extend the
underlying  data  structure.  Either  way,  std::stack<>  guarantees  it  will  be  safe,  so
that’s not a problem either.

 In the first overload of pop(), the code itself might throw an empty_stack exception c, but nothing has been modified, so that’s safe. The creation of res d might
throw  an  exception,  though,  for  a  couple  of  reasons:  the  call  to  std::make_shared
might throw because it can’t allocate memory for the new object and the internal
data required for reference counting, or the copy constructor or move constructor
of the data item to be returned might throw when copying/moving into the freshlyallocated memory. In both cases, the C++ runtime and Standard Library ensure that
there are no memory leaks and the new object (if any) is correctly destroyed. Because
you still haven’t modified the underlying stack, you’re OK. The call to data.pop() e
is guaranteed not to throw, as is the return of the result, so this overload of pop() is
exception-safe.

 The second overload of pop() is similar, except this time it’s the copy assignment
or move assignment operator that can throw f, rather than the construction of a new
object and an std::shared_ptr instance. Again, you don’t modify the data structure
until the call to data.pop() g, which is still guaranteed not to throw, so this overload
is exception-safe too.

 Finally, empty() doesn’t modify any data, so that’s exception-safe.
 There are a couple of opportunities for deadlock here, because you call user code
while  holding  a  lock:  the  copy  constructor  or  move  constructor  (B,  d)  and  copy
assignment or move assignment operator f on the contained data items, as well as
potentially a user-defined operator new. If these functions either call member functions on the stack that the item is being inserted into or removed from or require a
lock  of  any  kind  and  another  lock  was  held  when  the  stack  member  function  was
invoked, there’s the possibility of deadlock. But it’s sensible to require that users of
the stack be responsible for ensuring this; you can’t reasonably expect to add an item
onto a stack or remove it from a stack without copying it or allocating memory for it.

 Because all the member functions use std::lock_guard<> to protect the data, it’s
safe for any number of threads to call the stack member functions. The only member
functions that aren’t safe are the constructors and destructors, but this isn’t a problem; the object can be constructed only once and destroyed only once. Calling member functions on an incompletely constructed object or a partially destructed object is
never a good idea, whether done concurrently or not. As a consequence, the user must

Lock-based concurrent data structures

ensure that other threads aren’t able to access the stack until it’s fully constructed and
must ensure that all threads have ceased accessing the stack before it’s destroyed.

 Although it’s safe for multiple threads to call the member functions concurrently,
because of the use of locks, only one thread is ever doing any work in the stack data
structure at a time. This serialization of threads can potentially limit the performance
of an application where there’s significant contention on the stack: while a thread is
waiting for the lock, it isn’t doing any useful work. Also, the stack doesn’t provide any
means of waiting for an item to be added, so if a thread needs to wait, it must periodically call  empty(),  or  call  pop()  and  catch  the  empty_stack  exceptions.  This  makes
this stack implementation a poor choice if such a scenario is required, because a waiting  thread  must  either  consume  precious  resources  checking  for  data  or  the  user
must  write  external  wait  and  notification  code  (for  example,  using  condition  variables),  which  might  render  the  internal  locking  unnecessary  and  therefore  wasteful.
The queue from chapter 4 shows a way of incorporating this waiting into the data structure itself using a condition variable inside the data structure, so let’s look at that next.

### 6.2.2 A thread-safe queue using locks and condition variables

The thread-safe queue from chapter 4 is reproduced in listing 6.2. Much like the stack
was modeled after std::stack<>, this queue is modeled after std::queue<>. Again,
the interface differs from that of the standard container adaptor because of the constraints  of  writing  a  data  structure  that’s  safe  for  concurrent  access  from  multiple
threads.

Listing 6.2 The full class definition for a thread-safe queue using condition variables

```cpp
template<typename T>
class threadsafe_queue
{
```

private:
```cpp
    mutable std::mutex mut;
    std::queue<T> data_queue;
    std::condition_variable data_cond;
```

public:
    threadsafe_queue()
```cpp
    {}
    void push(T new_value)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        data_queue.push(std::move(new_value));
```

b
```cpp
        data_cond.notify_one();
    }
    void wait_and_pop(T& value)
    {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        data_cond.wait(lk,[this]{return !data_queue.empty();});
        value=std::move(data_queue.front());
        data_queue.pop();
    }
```

e

```cpp
    std::shared_ptr<T> wait_and_pop()
    {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        data_cond.wait(lk,[this]{return !data_queue.empty();});
        std::shared_ptr<T> res(
            std::make_shared<T>(std::move(data_queue.front())));
        data_queue.pop();
        return res;
    }
    bool try_pop(T& value)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        if(data_queue.empty())
            return false;
        value=std::move(data_queue.front());
        data_queue.pop();
        return true;
    }
    std::shared_ptr<T> try_pop()
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        if(data_queue.empty())
            return std::shared_ptr<T>();
        std::shared_ptr<T> res(
            std::make_shared<T>(std::move(data_queue.front())));
        data_queue.pop();
        return res;
    }
    bool empty() const
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        return data_queue.empty();
    }
```

};

- The structure of the queue implementation shown in listing 6.2 is similar to the stack
from listing 6.1, except for the call to data_cond.notify_one() in push() B and the
wait_and_pop()  functions,  c  and  d.  The  two  overloads  of  try_pop()  are  almost
identical  to  the  pop()  functions  from  listing  6.1,  except  that  they  don’t  throw  an
exception  if  the  queue  is  empty.  Instead,  they  return  either  a  bool value indicating
whether a value was retrieved or a NULL pointer if no value could be retrieved by the
pointer-returning overload f. This would also have been a valid way of implementing
the stack. If you exclude the wait_and_pop() functions, the analysis you did for the
stack applies just as well here.

 The new wait_and_pop() functions are a solution to the problem of waiting for a
queue entry that you saw with the stack; rather than continuously calling empty(), the
waiting thread can call wait_and_pop() and the data structure will handle the waiting
with a condition variable. The call to data_cond.wait() won’t return until the underlying queue has at least one element, so you don’t have to worry about the possibility
of an empty queue at this point in the code, and the data is still protected with the

Lock-based concurrent data structures

lock on the mutex. These functions don’t therefore add any new race conditions or
possibilities for deadlock, and the invariants will be upheld.

  There’s  a  slight  twist  with  regard  to  exception  safety  in  that  if  more  than  one
thread  is  waiting  when  an  entry  is  pushed  onto  the  queue,  only  one  thread  will  be
woken  by  the  call  to  data_cond.notify_one().  But  if  that  thread  then  throws  an
exception  in  wait_and_pop(),  such  as  when  the  new  std::shared_ptr<>  is  constructed e, none of the other threads will be woken. If this isn’t acceptable, the call is
readily replaced with data_cond.notify_all(), which will wake all the threads but at
the cost of most of them then going back to sleep when they find that the queue is
empty after all. A second alternative is to have wait_and_pop() call notify_one() if
an  exception  is  thrown,  so  that  another  thread  can  attempt  to  retrieve  the  stored
value.  A  third  alternative  is  to  move  the  std::shared_ptr<>  initialization  to  the
```cpp
push()  call  and  store  std::shared_ptr<>  instances  rather  than  direct  data  values.
```

Copying the std::shared_ptr<> out of the internal std::queue<> then can’t throw
an exception, so wait_and_pop() is safe again. The following listing shows the queue
implementation revised with this in mind.

```cpp
Listing 6.3 A thread-safe queue holding std::shared_ptr<> instances

template<typename T>
class threadsafe_queue
{
```

private:
```cpp
    mutable std::mutex mut;
    std::queue<std::shared_ptr<T> > data_queue;
    std::condition_variable data_cond;
```

public:
    threadsafe_queue()
```cpp
    {}
    void wait_and_pop(T& value)
    {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        data_cond.wait(lk,[this]{return !data_queue.empty();});
        value=std::move(*data_queue.front());
        data_queue.pop();
    }
    bool try_pop(T& value)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        if(data_queue.empty())
            return false;
        value=std::move(*data_queue.front());
        data_queue.pop();
        return true;
    }
    std::shared_ptr<T> wait_and_pop()
    {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        data_cond.wait(lk,[this]{return !data_queue.empty();});
        std::shared_ptr<T> res=data_queue.front();
```

b

e

```cpp
        data_queue.pop();
        return res;
    }
    std::shared_ptr<T> try_pop()
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        if(data_queue.empty())
            return std::shared_ptr<T>();
        std::shared_ptr<T> res=data_queue.front();
        data_queue.pop();
        return res;
    }
    void push(T new_value)
    {
        std::shared_ptr<T> data(
            std::make_shared<T>(std::move(new_value)));
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        data_queue.push(data);
        data_cond.notify_one();
    }
    bool empty() const
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mut);
        return data_queue.empty();
    }
```

};

- The  basic  consequences  of  holding  the  data  by  std::shared_ptr<>  are  straightforward:  the  pop  functions  that  take  a  reference  to  a  variable  to  receive  the  new  value
now  have  to  dereference  the  stored  pointer, B  and c,  and  the  pop  functions  that
return  an  std::shared_ptr<>  instance  can  retrieve  it  from  the  queue,  d  and  e,
before returning it to the caller.

 If the data is held by std::shared_ptr<>, there’s an additional benefit: the allocation of the new instance can now be done outside the lock in push() f, whereas in
listing 6.2 it had to be done while holding the lock in pop(). Because memory allocation  is  typically  quite  an  expensive  operation,  this  can  be  beneficial  for  the  performance  of  the  queue,  because  it  reduces  the  time  the  mutex  is  held,  allowing  other
threads to perform operations on the queue in the meantime.

 Just like in the stack example, the use of a mutex to protect the entire data structure limits the concurrency supported by this queue; although multiple threads might
be blocked on the queue in various member functions, only one thread can be doing
any work at a time. But part of this restriction comes from the use of std::queue<> in
the  implementation;  by  using  the  standard  container  you  now  have  one  data  item
that’s either protected or not. By taking control of the detailed implementation of the
data structure, you can provide more fine-grained locking and allow a higher level of
concurrency.

Lock-based concurrent data structures

### 6.2.3 A thread-safe queue using fine-grained locks and

condition variables

In listings 6.2 and 6.3 you have one protected data item (data_queue) and therefore
one mutex. In order to use finer-grained locking, you need to look inside the queue at
its constituent parts and associate one mutex with each distinct data item.

 The simplest data structure for a queue is a singly linked list, as shown in figure 6.1.
The queue contains a head pointer, which points to the first item in the list, and each
item then points to the next item. Data items are removed from the queue by replacing the head pointer with the pointer to the next item and then returning the data
from the old head.

Tail

Head

Figure 6.1 A queue represented using a single-linked list

Items are added to the queue at the other end. In order to do this, the queue also contains a tail pointer, which refers to the last item in the list. New nodes are added by
changing the next pointer of the last item to point to the new node and then updating the tail pointer to refer to the new item. When the list is empty, both the head
and tail pointers are NULL.

 The following listing shows a simple implementation of this queue based on a cutdown version of the interface to the queue in listing 6.2; you have only one try_pop()
function and no wait_and_pop() because this queue only supports single-threaded use.

First  off,  note  that  listing  6.4  uses  std::unique_ptr<node>  to  manage  the  nodes,
because this ensures that they (and the data they refer to) get deleted when they’re no
longer  needed,  without  having  to  write  an  explicit  delete.  This  ownership  chain  is
managed  from  head,  with  tail  being  a  raw  pointer  to  the  last  node,  as  it  needs  to
```cpp
refer to a node already owned by std::unique_ptr<node>.
```

 Although this implementation works fine in a single-threaded context, a couple of
things  will  cause  you  problems  if  you  try  to  use  fine-grained  locking  in  a  multithreaded  context.  Given  that  you  have  two  data  items  (head  B  and  tail  c),  you
could in principle use two mutexes, one to protect head and one to protect tail, but
there are a couple of problems with that.

 The most obvious problem is that push() can modify both head f and tail g, so
it would have to lock both mutexes. This isn’t too much of a problem, although it’s
unfortunate, because locking both mutexes would be possible. The critical problem
is  that  both  push()  and  pop()  access  the  next  pointer  of  a  node:  push()  updates
tail->next e,  and  try_pop()  reads  head->next d.  If  there’s  a  single  item  in  the

Lock-based concurrent data structures

queue,  then  head==tail,  so  both  head->next  and  tail->next  are  the  same  object,
which therefore requires protection. Because you can’t tell if it’s the same object without reading both head and tail, you now have to lock the same mutex in both push()
and try_pop(), so you’re no better off than before. Is there a way out of this dilemma?

ENABLING CONCURRENCY BY SEPARATING DATA
You can solve this problem by preallocating a dummy node with no data to ensure that
there’s always at least one node in the queue to separate the node being accessed at
the head from that being accessed at the tail. For an empty queue, head and tail now
both  point  to  the  dummy  node  rather  than  being  NULL.  This  is  fine,  because
try_pop() doesn’t access head->next if the queue is empty. If you add a node to the
queue (so there’s one real node), then head and tail now point to separate nodes, so
there’s no race on head->next and tail->next. The downside is that you have to add
an extra level of indirection to store the data by pointer in order to allow the dummy
nodes. The following listing shows how the implementation looks now.

Listing 6.5 A simple queue with a dummy node

```cpp
template<typename T>
class queue
{
```

private:
```cpp
    struct node
    {
        std::shared_ptr<T> data;
        std::unique_ptr<node> next;
```

    };
```cpp
    std::unique_ptr<node> head;
```

    node* tail;
public:
    queue():
        head(new node),tail(head.get())
```cpp
    {}
    queue(const queue& other)=delete;
    queue& operator=(const queue& other)=delete;
    std::shared_ptr<T> try_pop()
    {
        if(head.get()==tail)
        {
            return std::shared_ptr<T>();
        }
        std::shared_ptr<T> const res(head->data);
        std::unique_ptr<node> old_head=std::move(head);
        head=std::move(old_head->next);
        return res;
    }
    void push(T new_value)
    {
        std::shared_ptr<T> new_data(
            std::make_shared<T>(std::move(new_value)));
```

```cpp
        std::unique_ptr<node> p(new node);
```

j
```cpp
        tail->data=new_data;
        node* const new_tail=p.get();
        tail->next=std::move(p);
        tail=new_tail;
    }
```

};

The  changes  to  try_pop()  are  fairly  minimal.  First,  you’re  comparing  head  against
tail d, rather than checking for NULL, because the dummy node means that head is
never NULL. Because head is a std::unique_ptr<node>, you need to call head.get()
to do the comparison. Second, because the node now stores the data by pointer B,
you  can  retrieve  the  pointer  directly  e,  rather  than  having  to  construct  a  new
instance of T. The big changes are in push(): you must first create a new instance of T
on  the  heap  and  take  ownership  of  it  in  a  std::shared_ptr<> h  (note  the  use  of
std::make_shared to avoid the overhead of a second memory allocation for the reference count). The new node you create is going to be the new dummy node, so you
don’t need to supply the new_value to the constructor i. Instead, you set the data on
the  old  dummy  node  to  your  newly  allocated  copy  of  the  new_value j.  Finally,  in
order to have a dummy node, you have to create it in the constructor c.

 By now, I’m sure you’re wondering what these changes buy you and how they help
with making the queue thread-safe. Well, push() now  accesses only tail, not head,
which is an improvement. try_pop() accesses both head and tail, but tail is needed
only  for  the  initial  comparison,  so  the  lock  is  short-lived.  The  big  gain  is  that  the
dummy node means try_pop() and push() are never operating on the same node, so
you no longer need an overarching mutex. You can have one mutex for head and one
for tail. Where do you put the locks?

 You’re aiming for the maximum number of opportunities for concurrency, so you
want  to  hold  the  locks  for  the  shortest  possible  length  of  time.  push()  is  easy:  the
mutex needs to be locked across all accesses to tail, which means you lock the mutex
after the new node is allocated i, and before you assign the data to the current tail
node j. The lock then needs to be held until the end of the function.

 try_pop() isn’t so easy. First off, you need to lock the mutex on head and hold it
until you’re finished with head. This is the mutex to determine which thread does the
popping,  so  you  want  to  do  that  first.  Once  head  is  changed f,  you  can  unlock
the mutex; it doesn’t need to be locked when you return the result g. That leaves the
access to tail needing a lock on the tail mutex. Because you need to access tail only
once, you can just acquire the mutex for the time it takes to do the read. This is best
done  by  wrapping  it  in  a  function.  In  fact,  because  the  code  that  needs  the  head
mutex locked is only a subset of the member, it’s clearer to wrap that in a function too.
The final code is shown here.

    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> head_lock(head_mutex);

        {
            return nullptr;
        }
        std::unique_ptr<node> old_head=std::move(head);
        head=std::move(old_head->next);
        return old_head;
    }
```

public:
    threadsafe_queue():
        head(new node),tail(head.get())
```cpp
    {}
    threadsafe_queue(const threadsafe_queue& other)=delete;
    threadsafe_queue& operator=(const threadsafe_queue& other)=delete;
    std::shared_ptr<T> try_pop()
    {
        std::unique_ptr<node> old_head=pop_head();
        return old_head?old_head->data:std::shared_ptr<T>();
    }
    void push(T new_value)
    {
        std::shared_ptr<T> new_data(
            std::make_shared<T>(std::move(new_value)));
        std::unique_ptr<node> p(new node);
        node* const new_tail=p.get();
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> tail_lock(tail_mutex);
        tail->data=new_data;
        tail->next=std::move(p);
        tail=new_tail;
    }
```

};

Let’s look at this code with a critical eye, thinking about the guidelines listed in section 6.1.1. Before you look for broken invariants, you should be sure what they are:

- tail->next==nullptr.
- tail->data==nullptr.
- head==tail implies an empty list.
- A single element list has head->next==tail.
- For each node x in the list, where x!=tail, x->data points to an instance of T
and x->next points to the next node in the list. x->next==tail implies x is the
last node in the list.

- Following the next nodes from head will eventually yield tail.

On its own, push() is straightforward: the only modifications to the data structure are
protected by tail_mutex, and they uphold the invariant because the new tail node is
an empty node and data and next are correctly set for the old tail node, which is now
the last real node in the list.

  The  interesting  part  is  try_pop().  It  turns  out  that  not  only  is  the  lock  on
tail_mutex  necessary  to  protect  the  read  of  tail  itself,  but  it’s  also  necessary  to
ensure that you don’t get a data race reading the data from the  head. If you didn’t
have that mutex, it would be quite possible for a thread to call try_pop() and a thread
to call push() concurrently, and there’d be no defined ordering on their operations.
Even though each member function holds a lock on a mutex, they hold locks on different mutexes, and they potentially access the same data; all data in the queue originates
from a call to push(), after all. Because the threads would be potentially accessing the
same data without a defined ordering, this would be a data race, as you saw in chapter 5,
and  undefined  behavior.  Thankfully  the  lock  on  tail_mutex  in  get_tail()  solves
everything. Because the call to get_tail() locks the same mutex as the call to push(),
there’s  a  defined  order  between  the  two  calls.  Either  the  call  to  get_tail()  occurs
before the call to push(), in which case it sees the old value of tail, or it occurs after
the  call  to  push(),  in  which  case  it  sees  the  new  value  of  tail  and  the  new  data
attached to the previous value of tail.

  It’s  also  important  that  the  call  to  get_tail()  occurs  inside  the  lock  on  head_
mutex.  If  it  didn’t,  the  call  to  pop_head()  could  be  stuck  in  between  the  call  to
get_tail() and the lock on the head_mutex, because other threads called try_pop()
(and  thus  pop_head())  and  acquired  the  lock  first,  preventing  your  initial  thread
from making progress:

```cpp
    std::unique_ptr<node> pop_head()
    {
        node* const old_tail=get_tail();
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> head_lock(head_mutex);

This is a broken
```

implementation.

```cpp
        if(head.get()==old_tail)
        {
            return nullptr;
        }

Get old tail value
outside lock on
```

b

Lock-based concurrent data structures

```cpp
        std::unique_ptr<node> old_head=std::move(head);
        head=std::move(old_head->next);
        return old_head;
    }
```

In this broken scenario, where the call to get_tail(0) B is made outside the scope
of the lock, you might find that both head and tail have changed by the time your
initial thread can acquire the lock on head_mutex, and not only is the returned tail
node  no  longer  the  tail,  but  it’s  no  longer  even  part  of  the  list.  This  could  then
mean  that  the  comparison  of  head  to  old_tail  c  fails,  even  if  head  is  the  last
node.  Consequently,  when  you  update  head  d,  you  may  end  up  moving  head
beyond tail and off the end of the list, destroying the data structure. In the correct
implementation from listing 6.6, you keep the call to get_tail() inside the lock on
head_mutex.  This  ensures  that  no  other  threads  can  change  head,  and  tail  only
ever moves further away (as new nodes are added in calls to push()), which is perfectly safe. head can never pass the value returned from get_tail(), so the invariants are upheld.

 Once  pop_head() has removed the node from the queue by updating  head, the
mutex is unlocked, and try_pop() can extract the data and delete the node if there
was one (and return a NULL instance of std::shared_ptr<> if not), safe in the knowledge that it’s the only thread that can access this node.

 Next up, the external interface is a subset of that from listing 6.2, so the same analysis applies: there are no race conditions inherent in the interface.

 Exceptions are more interesting. Because you’ve changed the data allocation patterns,  the  exceptions  can  now  come  from  different  places.  The  only  operations  in
try_pop() that can throw exceptions are the mutex locks, and the data isn’t modified
until  the  locks  are  acquired.  Therefore  try_pop()  is  exception-safe.  On  the  other
hand, push() allocates a new instance of T on the heap and a new instance of node,
either of which might throw an exception. But both of the newly allocated objects are
assigned to smart pointers, so they’ll be freed if an exception is thrown. Once the lock
is acquired, none of the remaining operations in push() can throw an exception, so
again you’re home and dry and push() is exception-safe too.

 Because you haven’t changed the interface, there are no new external opportunities for deadlock. There are no internal opportunities, either; the only place that two
locks are acquired is in pop_head(), which always acquires the head_mutex, and then
the tail_mutex, so this will never deadlock.

 The remaining question concerns the possibilities for concurrency. This data structure has considerably more scope for concurrency than that from listing 6.2, because
the locks are more fine-grained and more is done outside the locks. For example, in
push(), the new node and new data item are allocated with no locks held. This means
that multiple threads can be allocating new nodes and data items concurrently without a problem. Only one thread can add its new node to the list at a time, but the code
to do so is only a few simple pointer assignments, so the lock isn’t held for much time

at  all  compared  to  the  std::queue<>-based  implementation  where  the  lock  is  held
around all the memory allocation operations internal to the std::queue<>.

 Also, try_pop()holds the tail_mutex for only a short time, to protect a read from
tail. Consequently, almost the entirety of a call to try_pop() can occur concurrently
with a call to push(). Also, the operations performed while holding the head_mutex
are quite minimal; the expensive delete (in the destructor of the node pointer) is outside  the  lock.  This  will  increase  the  number  of  calls  to  try_pop()  that  can  happen
concurrently; only one thread can call pop_head() at  a time, but multiple threads can
then delete their old nodes and return the data safely.

WAITING FOR AN ITEM TO POP
OK, so listing 6.6 provides a thread-safe queue with fine-grained locking, but it supports only try_pop() (and only one overload at that). What about the handy wait_
and_pop()  functions  back  in  listing  6.2?  Can  you  implement  an  identical  interface
with your fine-grained locking?

 The answer is yes, but the real question is how. Modifying push() is easy: add the
data_cond.notify_one()  call  at  the  end  of  the  function,  like  in  listing  6.2.  It’s  not
quite that simple; you’re using fine-grained locking because you want the maximum
possible  amount  of  concurrency.  If  you  leave  the  mutex  locked  across  the  call  to
notify_one()  (as  in  listing  6.2),  then  if  the  notified  thread  wakes  up  before  the
mutex has been unlocked, it will have to wait for the mutex. On the other hand, if you
unlock  the  mutex  before  you  call  notify_one(),  then  the  mutex  is  available  for  the
waiting thread to acquire when it wakes up (assuming no other thread locks it first).
This is a minor improvement, but it might be important in some cases.

 wait_and_pop() is more complicated, because you have to decide where to wait,
what the predicate is, and which mutex needs to be locked. The condition you’re waiting for is “queue not empty,” which is represented by head!=tail. Written like that, it
would  require  both  head_mutex  and  tail_mutex  to  be  locked,  but  you’ve  already
decided in listing 6.6 that you only need to lock tail_mutex for the read of tail and
not for the comparison itself, so you can apply the same logic here. If you make the
predicate head!=get_tail(), you only need to hold head_mutex, so you can use your
lock on that for the call to data_cond.wait(). Once you’ve added the wait logic, the
implementation is the same as try_pop().

 The second overload of try_pop() and the corresponding wait_and_pop() overload  require  careful  thought.  If  you  replace  the  return  of  std::shared_ptr<>
retrieved  from  old_head  with  a  copy  assignment  to  the  value  parameter,  there’s  a
potential exception-safety issue. At this point, the data item has been removed from
the queue and the mutex unlocked; all that remains is to return the data to the caller.
But  if  the  copy  assignment  throws  an  exception  (as  it  might),  the  data  item  is  lost
because it can’t be returned to the queue in the same place.

 If the actual type T used for the template argument has a no-throw move-assignment
operator or a no-throw swap operation, you could use that, but you’d prefer a general
solution that could be used for any type T. In this case, you have to move the potential

Lock-based concurrent data structures

throwing operation inside the locked region before the node is removed from the list.
This means you need an extra overload of pop_head() that retrieves the stored value
prior to modifying the list.

 In comparison, empty() is trivial: lock head_mutex and check for head== get_tail()
(see listing 6.10). The final code for the queue is shown in listings 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, and 6.10.

Listing 6.7 A thread-safe queue with locking and waiting: internals and interface

    std::shared_ptr<T> wait_and_pop();
    void wait_and_pop(T& value);
    void push(T new_value);
    bool empty();
```

};

Pushing  new  nodes  onto  the  queue  is  fairly  straightforward—the  implementation
(shown in the following listing) is close to that shown previously.

Listing 6.8 A thread-safe queue with locking and waiting: pushing new values

```cpp
template<typename T>
void threadsafe_queue<T>::push(T new_value)
{
    std::shared_ptr<T> new_data(
        std::make_shared<T>(std::move(new_value)));
    std::unique_ptr<node> p(new node);
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> tail_lock(tail_mutex);
        tail->data=new_data;
        node* const new_tail=p.get();
        tail->next=std::move(p);

        tail=new_tail;
    }
    data_cond.notify_one();
}
```

As already mentioned, the complexity is all in the pop side, which makes use of a series
of helper functions to simplify matters. The next listing shows the implementation of
wait_and_pop() and the associated helper functions.

- Lock-based concurrent data structures

The implementation of the pop side shown in listing 6.9 has several little helper functions  to  simplify  the  code  and  reduce  duplication,  such  as  pop_head()  B,  which
modifies the list to remove the head item, and wait_for_data() c, which waits for
the  queue  to  have  some  data  to  pop.  wait_for_data()  is  particularly  noteworthy,
because not only does it wait on the condition variable using a lambda function for
the predicate, but it also returns the lock instance to the caller d. This is to ensure
that the same lock is held while the data is modified by the relevant wait_pop_head()
overload, e and f. pop_head() is also reused by the try_pop() code shown in the
next listing.

This queue implementation will serve as the basis for the lock-free queue covered in
the queue as long as there’s available memory, even if no values are removed. The
alternative  to  an  unbounded  queue  is  a  bounded  queue,  in  which  the  maximum
length of the queue is fixed when the queue is created. Once a bounded queue is
full, attempts to push further elements onto the queue will either fail or block until
an element has been popped from the queue to make room. Bounded queues can
be useful for ensuring an even spread of work when dividing work between threads
based on tasks to be performed (see chapter 8). This prevents the thread(s) populating  the  queue  from  running  too  far  ahead  of  the  thread(s)  reading  items  from
the queue.

  The  unbounded  queue  implementation  shown  here  can  easily  be  extended  to
limit the length of the queue by waiting on the condition variable in push(). Rather
than waiting for the queue to have items (as is done in pop()), you need to wait for
the queue to have fewer than the maximum number of items. Further discussion of
bounded queues is outside the scope of this book; for now, let’s move beyond queues
and on to more complex data structures.

Designing more complex lock-based data structures
Stacks and queues are simple: the interface is exceedingly limited, and they’re tightly
focused on a specific purpose. Not all data structures are that simple; most data structures support a variety of operations. In principle, this can then lead to greater opportunities for concurrency, but it also makes the task of protecting the data that much
harder because the multiple access patterns need to be taken into account. The precise nature of the various operations that can be performed is important when designing these data structures for concurrent access.

 To see some of the issues involved, let’s look at the design of a lookup table.

## 6.3 6.3.1 Writing a thread-safe lookup table using locks

A lookup table or dictionary associates values of one type (the key type) with values of
either the same or a different type (the mapped type). In general, the intention behind
such a structure is to allow code to query the data associated with a given key. In the C++
Standard  Library,  this  facility  is  provided  by  the  associative  containers:  std::map<>,
```cpp
std::multimap<>, std::unordered_map<>, and std::unordered_multimap<>.

  A  lookup  table  has  a  different  usage  pattern  than  a  stack  or  a  queue.  Whereas
```

almost every operation on a stack or a queue modifies it in some way, either to add an
element  or  remove  one,  a  lookup  table  might  be  modified  rarely.  The  simple  DNS
cache in listing 3.13 is one example of this scenario, which features a greatly reduced
interface  compared  to  std::map<>.  As  you  saw  with  the  stack  and  queue,  the  interfaces  of  the  standard  containers  aren’t  suitable  when  the  data  structure  is  to  be
accessed from multiple threads concurrently, because there are inherent race conditions in the interface design, so they need to be cut down and revised.

Designing more complex lock-based data structures

 The biggest problem with the std::map<> interface from a concurrency perspective is the iterators. Although it’s possible to have an iterator that provides safe access
into a container even when other threads can access (and modify) the container, this
is  a  tricky  proposition.  Correctly  handling  iterators  requires  you  to  deal  with  issues
such  as  another  thread  deleting  the  element  that  the  iterator  is  referring  to,  which
can get rather involved. For the first cut at a thread-safe lookup table interface, you’ll
skip the iterators. Given that the interface to  std::map<> (and the other associative
containers in the standard library) is so heavily iterator-based, it’s probably worth setting them aside and designing the interface from the ground up.

 There are only a few basic operations on a lookup table:

- Add a new key/value pair.
- Change the value associated with a given key.
- Remove a key and its associated value.
- Obtain the value associated with a given key, if any.

There are also a few container-wide operations that might be useful, such as a check
on whether the container is empty, a snapshot of the complete list of keys, or a snapshot of the complete set of key/value pairs.

 If you stick to the simple thread-safety guidelines, such as not returning references,
and  put  a  simple  mutex  lock  around  the  entirety  of  each  member  function,  all  of
these  are  safe;  they  either  come  before  some  modification  from  another  thread  or
after  it.  The  biggest  potential  for  a  race  condition  is  when  a  new  key/value  pair  is
being added; if two threads add a new value, only one will be first, and the second will
therefore  fail.  One  possibility  is  to  combine  add  and  change  into  a  single  member
function, as you did for the DNS cache in listing 3.13.

 The only other interesting point from an interface perspective is the if any part of
obtaining an associated value. One option is to allow the user to provide a “default”
result that’s returned in the case when the key isn’t present:

```cpp
mapped_type get_value(key_type const& key, mapped_type default_value);
```

In  this  case,  a  default-constructed  instance  of  mapped_type  could  be  used  if  the
default_value wasn’t explicitly provided. This could also be extended to return an
std::pair<mapped_type,bool>  instead  of  just  an  instance  of  mapped_type,  where
the  bool  indicates  whether  the  value  was  present.  Another  option  is  to  return  a
smart pointer referring to the value; if the pointer value is NULL, there was no value
to return.

  As  already  mentioned,  once  the  interface  has  been  decided,  then  (assuming  no
interface  race  conditions)  the  thread  safety  could  be  guaranteed  by  using  a  single
mutex  and  a  simple  lock  around  every  member  function  to  protect  the  underlying
data structure. But this would squander the possibilities for concurrency provided by
the separate functions for reading the data structure and modifying it. One option is
to use a mutex that supports multiple reader threads or a single writer thread, such as

std::shared_mutex used in listing 3.13. Although this would indeed improve the possibilities for concurrent access, only one thread could modify the data structure at a
time. Ideally, you’d like to do better than that.

DESIGNING A MAP DATA STRUCTURE FOR FINE-GRAINED LOCKING
As with the queue discussed in section 6.2.3, in order to permit fine-grained locking
you need to look carefully at the details of the data structure rather than wrapping a
pre-existing container such as std::map<>. There are three common ways of implementing an associative container like your lookup table:

- A binary tree, such as a red-black tree
- A sorted array
- A hash table

A binary tree doesn’t provide much scope for extending the opportunities for concurrency;  every  lookup  or  modification  has  to  start  by  accessing  the  root  node,  which
therefore has to be locked. Although this lock can be released as the accessing thread
moves down the tree, this isn’t much better than a single lock across the whole data
structure.

 A sorted array is even worse, because you can’t tell in advance where in the array a

given data value is going to be, so you need a single lock for the whole array.

 That leaves the hash table. Assuming a fixed number of buckets, which bucket a
key belongs to is purely a property of the key and its hash function. This means you
can safely have a separate lock per bucket. If you again use a mutex that supports multiple readers or a single writer, you increase the opportunities for concurrency N-fold,
where N is the number of buckets. The downside is that you need a good hash function for the key. The C++ Standard Library provides the std::hash<> template, which
you can use for this purpose. It’s already specialized for fundamental types such as int
and common library types such as std::string, and the user can easily specialize it
for other key types. If you follow the lead of the standard unordered containers and
take the type of the function object to use for doing the hashing as a template parameter, the user can choose whether to specialize std::hash<> for their key type or provide a separate hash function.

  So,  let’s  look  at  some  code.  What  might  the  implementation  of  a  thread-safe

lookup table look like? One possibility is shown here.

```cpp
This  implementation  uses  a  std::vector<std::unique_ptr<bucket_type>>  g  to
```

hold  the  buckets,  which  allows  the  number  of  buckets  to  be  specified  in  the  constructor.  The  default  is  19,  which  is  an  arbitrary  prime  number;  hash  tables  work
best with a prime number of buckets. Each bucket is protected with an instance of
std::shared_mutex B to allow many concurrent reads or a single call to either of the
modification functions per bucket.

  Because  the  number  of  buckets  is  fixed,  the  get_bucket()  function  h  can  be
called without any locking (i, j, and 1)), and then the bucket mutex can be locked
either  for  shared  (read-only)  ownership  d,  or  unique  (read/write)  ownership,  e
and f, as appropriate for each function.

 All three functions make use of the find_entry_for() member function c on the
bucket to determine whether the entry is in the bucket. Each bucket contains just an
std::list<> of key/value pairs, so adding and removing entries is easy.

  I’ve  already  covered  the  concurrency  angle,  and  everything  is  suitably  protected
with mutex locks, so what about exception safety? value_for doesn’t modify anything,
so that’s fine; if it throws an exception, it won’t affect the data structure. remove_mapping
modifies the list with the call to erase, but this is guaranteed not to throw, so that’s
safe.  This  leaves  add_or_update_mapping,  which  might  throw  in  either  of  the  two
branches of if. push_back is exception-safe and will leave the list in the original state
if it throws, so that branch is fine. The only problem is with the assignment in the case
where you’re replacing an existing value; if the assignment throws, you’re relying on it
leaving the original unchanged. But this doesn’t affect the data structure as a whole
and is entirely a property of the user-supplied type, so you can safely leave it up to the
user to handle this.

Designing more complex lock-based data structures

 At the beginning of this section, I mentioned that one nice-to-have feature of such
a lookup table would be the option of retrieving a snapshot of the current state into,
for example, a std::map<>. This would require locking the entire container in order
to ensure that a consistent copy of the state is retrieved, which requires locking all the
buckets. Because the “normal” operations on the lookup table require a lock on only
one bucket at a time, this would be the only operation that requires a lock on all the
buckets. Therefore, provided you lock them in the same order every time (for example,  increasing  bucket  index),  there’ll  be  no  opportunity  for  deadlock.  This  implementation is shown in the following listing.

```cpp
Listing 6.12 Obtaining contents of a threadsafe_lookup_table as std::map<>

std::map<Key,Value> threadsafe_lookup_table::get_map() const
{
    std::vector<std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> > locks;
    for(unsigned i=0;i<buckets.size();++i)
    {
        locks.push_back(
            std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex>(buckets[i].mutex));
    }
    std::map<Key,Value> res;
    for(unsigned i=0;i<buckets.size();++i)
    {
        for(bucket_iterator it=buckets[i].data.begin();
            it!=buckets[i].data.end();
```

            ++it)
```cpp
        {
            res.insert(*it);
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

The lookup table implementation from listing 6.11 increases the opportunity for concurrency  of  the  lookup  table  as  a  whole  by  locking  each  bucket  separately  and  by
using a std::shared_mutex to allow reader concurrency on each bucket. But what if
you could increase the potential for concurrency on a bucket by even finer-grained
locking? In the next section, you’ll do exactly that by using a thread-safe list container
with iterator support.

### 6.3.2 Writing a thread-safe list using locks

A list is one of the most basic data structures, so it should be straightforward to write a
thread-safe one, shouldn’t it? Well, that depends on what facilities you’re after, and
you need one that offers iterator support, something I shied away from adding to your
map on the basis that it was too complicated. The basic issue with STL-style iterator
support is that the iterator must hold some kind of reference into the internal data
structure of the container. If the container can be modified from another thread, this
reference must somehow remain valid, which requires that the iterator hold a lock on

some  part  of  the  structure.  Given  that  the  lifetime  of  an  STL-style  iterator  is  completely outside the control of the container, this is a bad idea.

  The  alternative  is  to  provide  iteration  functions  such  as  for_each  as  part  of  the
container itself. This puts the container squarely in charge of the iteration and locking, but it does fall foul of the deadlock avoidance guidelines from chapter 3. In order
for for_each to do anything useful, it must call user-supplied code while holding the
internal lock. Not only that, but it must also pass a reference to each item to this usersupplied  code  in  order  for  the  user-supplied  code  to  work  on  this  item.  You  could
avoid this by passing a copy of each item to the user-supplied code, but that would be
expensive if the data items were large.

 So, for now you’ll leave it up to the user to ensure that they don’t cause deadlock
by acquiring locks in the user-supplied operations and don’t cause data races by storing the references for access outside the locks. In the case of the list being used by
the lookup table, this is perfectly safe, because you know you’re not going to do anything naughty.

 That leaves you with the question of which operations to supply for your list. If
you cast your eyes back to listings 6.11 and 6.12, you can see the sorts of operations
you require:

- Add an item to the list.
- Remove an item from the list if it meets a certain condition.
- Find an item in the list that meets a certain condition.
- Update an item that meets a certain condition.
- Copy each item in the list to another container.

For this to be a good general-purpose list container, it would be helpful to add further
operations, such as a positional insert, but this is unnecessary for your lookup table, so
I’ll leave it as an exercise for the reader.

 The basic idea with fine-grained locking for a linked list is to have one mutex per
node. If the list gets big, that’s a lot of mutexes! The benefit here is that operations on
separate parts of the list are truly concurrent: each operation holds only the locks on
the  nodes  it’s  interested  in  and  unlocks  each  node  as  it  moves  on  to  the  next.  The
next listing shows an implementation of this list.

        std::mutex m;

The threadsafe_list<> from listing 6.13 is a singly linked list, where each entry is a
node structure B. A default-constructed  node is used for the  head of the list, which
starts with a NULL next pointer c. New nodes are added with the push_front() function; first a new node is constructed e, which allocates the stored data on the heap
d, while leaving the next pointer as NULL. You then need to acquire the lock on the
mutex for the head node in order to get the appropriate next value f and insert the
node at the front of the list by setting head.next to point to your new node g. So far,
so good: you only need to lock one mutex in order to add a new item to the list, so
there’s  no  risk  of  deadlock.  Also,  the  slow  memory  allocation  happens  outside  the
lock, so the lock is only protecting the update of a couple of pointer values that can’t
fail. On to the iterative functions.

 First up, let’s look at for_each() h. This operation takes a Function of some type
to apply to each element in the list; in common with most standard library algorithms,
it  takes  this  function  by  value  and  will  work  with  either  a  genuine  function  or  an
object of a type with a function call operator. In this case, the function must accept a
value of type T as the sole parameter. Here’s where you do the hand-over-hand locking. To start with, you lock the mutex on the head node i. It’s then safe to obtain the
pointer  to  the  next  node  (using  get()  because  you’re  not  taking  ownership  of  the
pointer). If that pointer isn’t NULL j, you lock the mutex on that node 1) in order to
process the data. Once you have the lock on that node, you can release the lock on
the previous node 1! and call the specified function 1@. Once the function completes,
you can update the current pointer to the node you processed and move the ownership of the lock from next_lk out to lk 1#. Because for_each passes each data item

### Summary

directly to the supplied Function, you can use this to update the items if necessary,
or copy them into another container, or whatever. This is entirely safe if the function is well behaved, because the mutex for the node holding the data item is held
across the call.

 find_first_if() 1$ is similar to for_each(); the crucial difference is that the
supplied Predicate must return true to indicate a match or false to indicate no
match 1%. Once you have a match, you return the found data 1^, rather than continuing  to  search.  You  could  do  this  with  for_each(),  but  it  would  needlessly  continue
processing the rest of the list even once a match had been found.

 remove_if() 1& is slightly different, because this function has to update the list;
you can’t use for_each() for this. If the Predicate returns true 1*, you remove the
node  from  the  list  by  updating  current->next 1(.  Once  you’ve  done  that,  you  can
release the lock held on the mutex for the next node. The node is deleted when the
std::unique_ptr<node> you moved it into goes out of scope 2). In this case, you don’t
update  current  because  you  need  to  check  the  new  next  node.  If  the  Predicate
returns false, you want to move on as before 2!.

 So, are there any deadlocks or race conditions with all these mutexes? The answer
here  is  quite  definitely  no,  provided  that  the  supplied  predicates  and  functions  are
well behaved. The iteration is always one way, always starting from the head node, and
always locking the next mutex before releasing the current one, so there’s no possibility  of  different  lock  orders  in  different  threads.  The  only  potential  candidate  for  a
race condition is the deletion of the removed node in remove_if() 2), because you
do this after you’ve unlocked the mutex (it’s undefined behavior to destroy a locked
mutex). But a few moments’ thought reveals that this is indeed safe, because you still
hold the mutex on the previous node (current), so no new thread can try to acquire
the lock on the node you’re deleting.

 What about opportunities for concurrency? The whole point of this fine-grained
locking was to improve the possibilities for concurrency over a single mutex, so have
you achieved that? Yes, you have: different threads can be working on different nodes
in the list at the same time, whether they’re processing each item with for_each(),
searching with find_first_if(), or removing items with remove_if(). But because
the mutex for each node must be locked in turn, the threads can’t pass each other. If
one thread is spending a long time processing a particular node, other threads will
have to wait when they reach that particular node.

### Summary

This chapter started by looking at what it means to design a data structure for concurrency and providing some guidelines for doing so. We then worked through several common data structures (stack, queue, hash map, and linked list), looking at
how to apply those guidelines to implement them in a way designed for concurrent
access,  using  locks  to  protect  the  data  and  prevent  data  races.  You  should  now  be

able to look at the design of your own data structures to see where the opportunities
for concurrency lie and where there’s potential for race conditions.

 In chapter 7 we’ll look at ways of avoiding locks entirely, using the low-level atomic
operations to provide the necessary ordering constraints, while sticking to the same
set of guidelines.
