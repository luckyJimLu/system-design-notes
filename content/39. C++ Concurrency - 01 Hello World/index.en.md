Hello, world of
concurrency in C++!

This chapter covers

- Why you might want to use concurrency and

multithreading in your applications
- Some of the history of the support for

concurrency in C++

- What a simple multithreaded C++ program

looks like

These are exciting times for C++ users. Thirteen years after the original C++ Standard was published in 1998, the C++ Standards Committee gave the language and
its  supporting  library  a  major  overhaul.  The  new  C++  Standard  (referred  to  as
C++11 or C++0x) was published in 2011 and brought with it a swath of changes that
made working with C++ easier and more productive. The Committee also committed to a new “train model” of releases, with a new C++ Standard to be published
every three years. So far, we've had two of these publications: the C++14 Standard in
2014, and the C++17 Standard in 2017, as well as several Technical Specifications
describing extensions to the C++ Standard.

 One of the most significant new features in the C++11 Standard was the support of
multithreaded programs. For the first time, the C++ Standard acknowledged the existence of multithreaded applications in the language and provided components in the
library  for  writing  multithreaded  applications.  This  made  it  possible  to  write  multithreaded C++ programs without relying on platform-specific extensions and enabled
you to write portable multithreaded code with guaranteed behavior. It also came at a
time  when  programmers  were  increasingly  looking  to  concurrency  in  general,  and
multithreaded programming in particular, to improve application performance. The
C++14 and C++17 Standards have built upon this baseline to provide further support
for  writing  multithreaded  programs  in  C++,  as  have  the  Technical  Specifications.
There’s a Technical Specification for concurrency extensions, and another for parallelism, though the latter has been incorporated into C++17.

  This  book  is  about  writing  programs  in  C++  using  multiple  threads  for  concurrency  and  the  C++  language  features  and  library  facilities  that  make  it  possible.  I’ll
start  by  explaining  what  I  mean  by  concurrency  and  multithreading  and  why  you
would want to use concurrency in your applications. After a quick detour into why you
might not want to use it in your applications, we’ll go through an overview of the concurrency support in C++, and we’ll round off this chapter with a simple example of
C++  concurrency  in  action.  Readers  experienced  with  developing  multithreaded
applications may wish to skip the early sections. In subsequent chapters, we’ll cover
more extensive examples and look at the library facilities in more depth. The book
will finish with an in-depth reference to all the C++ Standard Library facilities for multithreading and concurrency.

 So, what do I mean by concurrency and multithreading?

## 1.1 What is concurrency?

At the simplest and most basic level, concurrency is about two or more separate activities happening at the same time. We encounter concurrency as a natural part of life;
we can walk and talk at the same time or perform different actions with each hand,
and we each go about our lives independently of each other—you can watch football
while I go swimming, and so on.

### 1.1.1 Concurrency in computer systems

When we talk about concurrency in terms of computers, we mean a single system performing multiple independent activities in parallel, rather than sequentially, or one
after  the  other.  This  isn’t  a  new  phenomenon.  Multitasking  operating  systems  that
allow  a  single  desktop  computer  to  run  multiple  applications  at  the  same  time
through  task  switching  have  been  commonplace  for  many  years,  as  have  high-end
server  machines  with  multiple  processors  that  enable  genuine  concurrency.  What’s
new is the increased prevalence of computers that can genuinely run multiple tasks in
parallel rather than giving the illusion of doing so.

What is concurrency?

 Historically, most desktop computers have had one processor, with a single processing  unit  or  core,  and  this  remains  true  for  many  desktop  machines  today.  Such  a
machine can only perform one task at a time, but it can switch between tasks many times
per second. By doing a bit of one task and then a bit of another and so on, it appears
that the tasks are happening concurrently. This is called task switching. We still talk about
concurrency  with  such  systems;  because  the  task  switches  are  so  fast,  you  can’t  tell  at
which point a task may be suspended as the processor switches to another one. The task
switching  provides  the  illusion  of  concurrency  to  both  the  user  and  the  applications
themselves. Because there is only the illusion of concurrency, the behavior of applications may be subtly different when executing in a single-processor task-switching environment  compared  to  when  executing  in  an  environment  with  true  concurrency.  In
particular, incorrect assumptions about the memory model (covered in chapter 5) may
not show up in such an environment. This is discussed in more depth in chapter 10.

 Computers containing multiple processors have been used for servers and highperformance  computing  tasks  for  years,  and  computers  based  on  processors  with
more  than  one  core  on  a  single  chip  (multicore  processors)  are  becoming  increasingly common as desktop machines. Whether they have multiple processors or multiple  cores  within  a  processor  (or  both),  these  computers  are  capable  of  genuinely
running more than one task in parallel. We call this hardware concurrency.

 Figure 1.1 shows an idealized scenario of a computer with precisely two tasks to do,
each  divided  into  10  equally  sized  chunks.  On  a  dual-core  machine  (which  has  two
processing cores), each task can execute on its own core. On a single-core machine
doing  task  switching,  the  chunks  from  each  task  are  interleaved.  But  they  are  also
spaced out a bit (in figure 1.1, this is shown by the gray bars separating the chunks
being thicker than the separator bars shown for the dual-core machine); in order to
do  the  interleaving,  the  system  has  to  perform  a  context  switch  every  time  it  changes
from one task to another, and this takes time. In order to perform a context switch,
the OS has to save the CPU state and instruction pointer for the currently running
task,  work  out  which  task  to  switch  to,  and  reload  the  CPU  state  for  the  task  being
switched to. The CPU will then potentially have to load the memory for the instructions and data for the new task into the cache, which can prevent the CPU from executing any instructions, causing further delay.

Figure 1.1 Two approaches to concurrency: parallel execution on a dual-core
machine versus task switching on a single-core machine

Though the availability of concurrency in the hardware is most obvious with multiprocessor or multicore systems, some processors can execute multiple threads on a single
core. The important factor to consider is the number of hardware threads, which is the
measure  of  how  many  independent  tasks  the  hardware  can  genuinely  run  concurrently.  Even  with  a  system  that  has  genuine  hardware  concurrency,  it’s  easy  to  have
more tasks than the hardware can run in parallel, so task switching is still used in these
cases.  For  example,  on  a  typical  desktop  computer  there  may  be  hundreds  of  tasks
running, performing background operations, even when the computer is nominally
idle. It’s the task switching that allows these background tasks to run and you to run
your word processor, compiler, editor, and web browser (or any combination of applications) all at once. Figure 1.2 shows task switching among four tasks on a dual-core
machine,  again  for  an  idealized  scenario  with  the  tasks  divided  neatly  into  equally
sized chunks. In practice, many issues will make the divisions uneven and the scheduling irregular. Some of these issues are covered in chapter 8 when we look at factors
affecting the performance of concurrent code.

All the techniques, functions, and classes covered in this book can be used whether
your application is running on a machine with one single-core processor or with many
multicore  processors,  and  are  not  affected  by  whether  the  concurrency  is  achieved
through task switching or by genuine hardware concurrency. But as you may imagine,
how  you  make  use  of  concurrency  in  your  application  may  well  depend  on  the
amount of hardware concurrency available. This is covered in chapter 8, where I discuss the issues involved in designing concurrent code in C++.

### 1.1.2 Approaches to concurrency

Imagine, for a moment, a pair of programmers working together on a software project. If your developers are in separate offices, they can go about their work peacefully,
without being disturbed by each other, and they each have their own set of reference
manuals. But communication isn’t straightforward; rather than turning around and
talking to each other, they have to use the phone or email, or get up and walk to the
other’s office. Also, you have the overhead of two offices to manage and multiple copies of reference manuals to purchase.

 Now imagine that you move your developers into the same office. They can now
talk to each other freely to discuss the design of the application, and they can easily

What is concurrency?

draw diagrams on paper or on a whiteboard to help with design ideas or explanations.
You have only one office to manage, and one set of resources will often suffice. On the
negative side, they might find it harder to concentrate, and there may be issues with
sharing resources (“Where’s the reference manual gone now?”).

 These two ways of organizing your developers illustrate the two basic approaches
to concurrency. Each developer represents a thread, and each office represents a process. The first approach is to have multiple single-threaded processes, which is similar
to having each developer in their own office, and the second approach is to have multiple threads in a single process, which is like having two developers in the same office.
You can combine these in an arbitrary fashion and have multiple processes, some of
which  are  multithreaded  and  some  of  which  are  single-threaded,  but  the  principles
are the same. Let’s now have a brief look at these two approaches to concurrency in
an application.

CONCURRENCY WITH MULTIPLE PROCESSES
The first way to make use of concurrency within an application is to divide the application into multiple, separate,
single-threaded  processes  that  are  run  at  the  same  time,
much as you can run your web browser and word processor  at  the  same  time.  These  separate  processes  can  then
pass messages to each other through all the normal interprocess  communication  channels  (signals,  sockets,  files,
pipes, and so on), as shown in figure 1.3. One downside is
that  such  communication  between  processes  is  often
either  complicated  to  set  up  or  slow,  or  both,  because
operating  systems  typically  provide  a  lot  of  protection
between processes to avoid one process accidentally modifying data belonging to another process. Another downside
is that there’s an inherent overhead in running multiple
processes:  it  takes  time  to  start  a  process,  the  operating
system  must  devote  internal  resources  to  managing  the
process, and so forth.

  It’s  not  all  negative:  the  added  protection  operating  systems  typically  provide
between  processes  and  the  higher-level  communication  mechanisms  mean  that  it
can  be  easier  to  write  safe  concurrent  code  with  processes  rather  than  threads.
Indeed, environments such as that provided for the Erlang (www.erlang.org/) programming  language  use  processes  as  the  fundamental  building  block  of  concurrency to great effect.

 Using separate processes for concurrency also has an additional advantage—you
can run the separate processes on distinct machines connected over a network. Though
this increases the communication cost, on a carefully designed system it can be a costeffective way of increasing the available parallelism and improving performance.

CONCURRENCY WITH MULTIPLE THREADS
The alternative approach to concurrency is to run multiple
threads  in  a  single  process.  Threads  are  much  like  lightweight  processes:  each  thread  runs  independently  of  the
others, and each may run a different sequence of instructions.  But  all  threads  in  a  process  share  the  same  address
space, and most of the data can be accessed directly from
all threads—global variables remain global, and pointers or
references to objects or data can be passed around among
threads.  Although  it’s  often  possible  to  share  memory
among  processes,  this  is  complicated  to  set  up  and  often
hard  to  manage,  because  memory  addresses  of  the  same
data aren’t necessarily the same in different processes. Figure 1.4 shows two threads within a process communicating
through shared memory.

 The shared address space and lack of protection of data between threads makes
the  overhead  associated  with  using  multiple  threads  much  smaller  than  that  from
using  multiple  processes,  because  the  operating  system  has  less  bookkeeping  to  do.
But the flexibility of shared memory also comes with a price: if data is accessed by multiple threads, the application programmer must ensure that the view of data seen by
each thread is consistent whenever it’s accessed. The issues surrounding sharing data
between threads, and the tools to use and guidelines to follow to avoid problems, are
covered throughout this book, notably in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 8. The problems aren’t
insurmountable, provided suitable care is taken when writing the code, but they do
mean that a great deal of thought must go into the communication between threads.
 The low overhead associated with launching and communicating between multiple  threads  within  a  process  compared  to  launching  and  communicating  between
multiple single-threaded processes means that this is the favored approach to concurrency in mainstream languages, including C++, despite the potential problems arising
from the shared memory. In addition, the C++ Standard doesn’t provide any intrinsic
support for communication between processes, so applications that use multiple processes will have to rely on platform-specific APIs to do so. This book therefore focuses
exclusively on using multithreading for concurrency, and future references to concurrency assume that this is achieved by using multiple threads.

 There’s another word that gets used a lot around multithreaded code: parallelism.

Let’s clarify the differences.

### 1.1.3 Concurrency vs. parallelism

Concurrency  and  parallelism  have  largely  overlapping  meanings  with  respect  to
multithreaded code. Indeed, to many they mean the same thing. The difference is
primarily a matter of nuance, focus, and intent. Both terms are about running multiple tasks simultaneously, using the available hardware, but parallelism is much more

Why use concurrency?

performance-oriented.  People  talk  about  parallelism  when  their  primary  concern  is
taking advantage of the available hardware to increase the performance of bulk data
processing, whereas people talk about concurrency when their primary concern is separation of concerns, or responsiveness. This dichotomy is not cut and dried, and there
is still considerable overlap in meaning, but it can help clarify discussions to know of
this distinction. Throughout this book, there will be examples of both.

 Having clarified what we mean by concurrency and parallelism, let’s look at why

you would use concurrency in your applications.

## 1.2 Why use concurrency?

There are two main reasons to use concurrency in an application: separation of concerns and performance. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that they’re almost the only reasons to use concurrency; anything else boils down to one or the other (or maybe even
both) when you look hard enough (well, except for reasons like “because I want to”).

### 1.2.1 Using concurrency for separation of concerns

Separation of concerns is almost always a good idea when writing software; by grouping related bits of code together and keeping unrelated bits of code apart, you can
make your programs easier to understand and test, and less likely to contain bugs. You
can use concurrency to separate distinct areas of functionality, even when the operations in these distinct areas need to happen at the same time; without the explicit use
of concurrency, you either have to write a task-switching framework or actively make
calls to unrelated areas of code during an operation.

 Consider a processing-intensive application with a user interface, such as a DVD
player  application  for  a  desktop  computer.  This  application  fundamentally  has  two
sets of responsibilities. Not only does it have to read the data from the disk, decode
the images and sound, and send them to the graphics and sound hardware in a timely
fashion so the DVD plays without glitches, but it must also take input from the user,
such  as  when  the  user  clicks  Pause  or  Return  To  Menu,  or  even  Quit.  In  a  single
thread, the application has to check for user input at regular intervals during the playback, conflating the DVD playback code with the user interface code. By using multithreading to separate these concerns, the user interface code and DVD playback code
no longer have to be so closely intertwined; one thread can handle the user interface
and another the DVD playback. There will have to be interaction between them, such
as when the user clicks Pause, but now these interactions are directly related to the
task at hand.

 This gives the illusion of responsiveness, because the user interface thread can typically respond immediately to a user request, even if the response is to display a busy
cursor or a Please Wait message while the request is conveyed to the thread doing the
work. Similarly, separate threads are often used to run tasks that must run continuously in the background, such as monitoring the filesystem for changes in a desktop
search application. Using threads in this way generally makes the logic in each thread

much simpler, because the interactions between them can be limited to clearly identifiable points, rather than having to intersperse the logic of the different tasks.

 In this case, the number of threads is independent of the number of CPU cores
available, because the division into threads is based on the conceptual design rather
than an attempt to increase throughput.

### 1.2.2 Using concurrency for performance: task and data parallelism

Multiprocessor systems have existed for decades, but until recently they were mostly
found only in supercomputers, mainframes, and large server systems. But chip manufacturers have increasingly been favoring multicore designs with 2, 4, 16, or more processors  on  a  single  chip  over  better  performance  with  a  single  core.  Consequently,
multicore desktop computers, and even multicore embedded devices, are now increasingly prevalent. The increased computing power of these machines comes not from
running a single task faster but from running multiple tasks in parallel. In the past,
programmers have been able to sit back and watch their programs get faster with each
new generation of processors, without any effort on their part. But now, as Herb Sutter put it, “The free lunch is over.”1 If software is to take advantage of this increased
computing power, it must be designed to run multiple tasks concurrently. Programmers  must  therefore  take  heed,  and  those  who  have  hitherto  ignored  concurrency
must now look to add it to their toolbox.

 There are two ways to use concurrency for performance. The first, and most obvious, is to divide a single task into parts and run each in parallel, reducing the total
runtime. This is task parallelism. Although this sounds straightforward, it can be quite a
complex  process,  because  there  may  be  many  dependencies  between  the  various
parts. The divisions may be either in terms of processing—one thread performs one
part of the algorithm while another thread performs a different part—or in terms of
data—each thread performs the same operation on different parts of the data. This
latter approach is called data parallelism.

  Algorithms  that  are  readily  susceptible  to  such  parallelism  are  frequently  called
embarrassingly parallel. Despite the implication that you might be embarrassed to have
code so easy to parallelize, this is a good thing; other terms I’ve encountered for such
algorithms are naturally parallel and conveniently concurrent. Embarrassingly parallel algorithms have good scalability properties—as the number of available hardware threads
goes  up,  the  parallelism  in  the  algorithm  can  be  increased  to  match.  Such  an  algorithm  is  the  perfect  embodiment  of  the  adage,  “Many  hands  make  light  work.”  For
those parts of the algorithm that aren’t embarrassingly parallel, you might be able to
divide  the  algorithm  into  a  fixed  (and  therefore  not  scalable)  number  of  parallel
tasks. Techniques for dividing tasks between threads are covered in chapters 8 and 10.
 The second way to use concurrency for performance is to use the available parallelism to solve bigger problems; rather than processing one file at a time, process 2, or

Journal, 30(3), March 2005. http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm.

Why use concurrency?

10,  or  20,  as  appropriate.  Although  this  is  an  application  of  data  parallelism,  by  performing the same operation on multiple sets of data concurrently, there’s a different
focus. It still takes the same amount of time to process one chunk of data, but now
more data can be processed in the same amount of time. Obviously, there are limits
to this approach, and this won’t be beneficial in all cases, but the increase in throughput
that comes from this approach can make new things possible—increased resolution
in video processing, for example, if different areas of the picture can be processed
in parallel.

### 1.2.3 When not to use concurrency

It’s just as important to know when not to use concurrency as it is to know when to use
it.  Fundamentally,  the  only  reason  not  to  use  concurrency  is  when  the  benefit  isn’t
worth  the  cost.  Code  using  concurrency  is  harder  to  understand  in  many  cases,  so
there’s a direct intellectual cost to writing and maintaining multithreaded code, and
the  additional  complexity  can  also  lead  to  more  bugs.  Unless  the  potential  performance gain is large enough or the separation of concerns is clear enough to justify the
additional development time required to get it right and the additional costs associated with maintaining multithreaded code, don’t use concurrency.

 Also, the performance gain might not be as large as expected; there’s an inherent
overhead associated with launching a thread, because the OS has to allocate the associated kernel resources and stack space and then add the new thread to the scheduler,
all of which takes time. If the task being run on the thread is completed quickly, the
time taken by the task may be dwarfed by the overhead of launching the thread, possibly making the overall performance of the application worse than if the task had been
executed directly by the spawning thread.

  Furthermore,  threads  are  a  limited  resource.  If  you  have  too  many  threads  running at once, this consumes OS resources and may make the system as a whole run
slower. Not only that, but using too many threads can exhaust the available memory or
address space for a process, because each thread requires a separate stack space. This
is particularly a problem for 32-bit processes with a flat architecture where there’s a 4 GB
limit to the available address space: if each thread has a 1 MB stack (as is typical on
many systems), then the address space would be used up with 4,096 threads, without
allowing any space for code, static data, or heap data. Although 64-bit (or larger) systems don’t have this direct address-space limit, they still have finite resources: if you
run too many threads, this will eventually cause problems. Though thread pools (see
they do have their own issues.

 If the server side of a client/server application launches a separate thread for each
connection,  this  will  work  fine  for  a  small  number  of  connections,  but  can  quickly
exhaust system resources by launching too many threads if the same technique is used
for a high-demand server that has to handle many connections. In this scenario, careful use of thread pools can provide optimal performance (see chapter 9).

 Finally, the more threads you have running, the more context switching the operating system has to do. Each context switch takes time that could be spent doing useful work, so at some point, adding an extra thread will reduce the overall application
performance  rather  than  increase  it.  For  this  reason,  if  you’re  trying  to  achieve  the
best possible performance of the system, it’s necessary to adjust the number of threads
running to take into account the available hardware concurrency (or lack of it).

 The use of concurrency for performance is like any other optimization strategy: it
has the potential to greatly improve the performance of your application, but it can
also complicate the code, making it harder to understand and more prone to bugs.
Therefore,  it’s  only  worth  doing  for  those  performance-critical  parts  of  the  application where there’s the potential for measurable gain. Of course, if the potential for
performance gains is only secondary to clarity of design or separation of concerns, it
may still be worth using a multithreaded design.

 Assuming that you’ve decided you do want to use concurrency in your application,
whether  for  performance,  separation  of  concerns,  or  because  it’s  “multithreading
Monday,” what does that mean for C++ programmers?

## 1.3 Concurrency and multithreading in C++

Standardized  support  for  concurrency  through  multithreading  is  a  relatively  new
thing for C++. It’s only since the C++11 Standard that you’ve been able to write multithreaded  code  without  resorting  to  platform-specific  extensions.  In  order  to  understand the rationale behind lots of the decisions in the Standard C++ Thread Library,
it’s important to understand the history.

### 1.3.1 History of multithreading in C++

The 1998 C++ Standard doesn’t acknowledge the existence of threads, and the operational  effects  of  the  various  language  elements  are  written  in  terms  of  a  sequential
abstract machine. Not only that, but the memory model isn’t formally defined, so you
can’t  write  multithreaded  applications  without  compiler-specific  extensions  to  the
1998 C++ Standard.

 Compiler vendors are free to add extensions to the language, and the prevalence
of C APIs for multithreading—such as those in the POSIX C standard and the Microsoft  Windows  API—has  led  many  C++  compiler  vendors  to  support  multithreading
with various platform-specific extensions. This compiler support is generally limited to
allowing the use of the corresponding C API for the platform and ensuring that the
C++ Runtime Library (such as the code for the exception-handling mechanism) works
in the presence of multiple threads. Although few compiler vendors have provided a
formal multithreading-aware memory model, the behavior of the compilers and processors  has  been  sufficiently  good  that  a  large  number  of  multithreaded  C++  programs have been written.

 Not content with using the platform-specific C APIs for handling multithreading,
C++  programmers  have  looked  to  their  class  libraries  to  provide  object-oriented

Concurrency and multithreading in C++

multithreading facilities. Application frameworks, such as MFC, and general-purpose
C++ libraries, such as Boost and ACE, have accumulated sets of C++ classes that wrap
the  underlying  platform-specific  APIs  and  provide  higher-level  facilities  for  multithreading  that  simplify  tasks.  Although  the  precise  details  of  the  class  libraries  vary
considerably, particularly in the area of launching new threads, the overall shape of
the classes has a lot in common. One particularly important design that’s common to
many C++ class libraries, and that provides considerable benefit to the programmer, is
the use of the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idiom with locks to ensure
that mutexes are unlocked when the relevant scope is exited.

 For many cases, the multithreading support of existing C++ compilers combined
with the availability of platform-specific APIs and platform-independent class libraries,
such as Boost and ACE, provide a solid foundation on which to write multithreaded
C++ code, and as a result, there are probably millions of lines of C++ code written as
part of multithreaded applications. But the lack of standard support means that there
are occasions where the lack of a thread-aware memory model causes problems, particularly for those who try to gain higher performance by using knowledge of the processor  hardware  or  for  those  writing  cross-platform  code  where  the  behavior  of  the
compilers varies between platforms.

### 1.3.2 Concurrency support in the C++11 standard

All this changed with the release of the C++11 Standard. Not only is there a threadaware memory model, but the C++ Standard Library was extended to include classes
for  managing  threads  (see  chapter  2),  protecting  shared  data  (see  chapter  3),  synchronizing operations between threads (see chapter 4), and low-level atomic operations (see chapter 5).

 The C++11 Thread Library is heavily based on the prior experience accumulated
through  the  use  of  the  C++  class  libraries  mentioned  previously.  In  particular,  the
Boost  Thread  Library  was  used  as  the  primary  model  on  which  the  new  library  is
based,  with  many  of  the  classes  sharing  their  names  and  structure  with  the  corresponding ones from Boost. As the standard has evolved, this has been a two-way flow,
and the Boost Thread Library has itself changed to match the C++ Standard in many
respects, so users transitioning from Boost should find themselves at home.

  Concurrency  support  is  one  of  the  changes  with  the  C++11  Standard—as  mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, there are many enhancements to the language
to make programmers’ lives easier. Although these are generally outside the scope of
this book, some of those changes have had a direct impact on the Thread Library and
the ways in which it can be used. Appendix A provides a brief introduction to these
language features.

### 1.3.3 More support for concurrency and parallelism in C++14

and C++17

The only specific support for concurrency and parallelism added in C++14 was a new
mutex type for protecting shared data (see chapter 3). But C++17 adds considerably
more:  a  full  suite  of  parallel  algorithms  (see  chapter  10)  for  starters.  Both  of  these
Standards enhance the core language and the rest of the Standard Library, and these
enhancements can simplify the writing of multithreaded code.

 As mentioned previously, there’s also a Technical Specification for concurrency,
which describes extensions to the functions and classes provided by the C++ Standard,
especially around synchronizing operations between threads (see chapter 4).

 The support for atomic operations directly in C++ enables programmers to write
efficient code with defined semantics without the need for platform-specific assembly
language. This is a real boon for those trying to write efficient, portable code; not only
does the compiler take care of the platform specifics, but the optimizer can be written
to take into account the semantics of the operations, enabling better optimization of
the program as a whole.

### 1.3.4 Efficiency in the C++ Thread Library

One of the concerns that developers involved in high-performance computing often
raise regarding C++ in general, and C++ classes that wrap low-level facilities—such as
those  in  the  new  Standard  C++  Thread  Library  specifically—is  that  of  efficiency.  If
you’re after the utmost in performance, it’s important to understand the implementation costs associated with using any high-level facilities, compared to using the underlying low-level facilities directly. This cost is the abstraction penalty.

 The C++ Standards Committee was aware of this when designing the C++ Standard
Library  in  general  and  the  Standard  C++  Thread  Library  in  particular;  one  of  the
design goals has been that there should be little or no benefit to be gained from using
the lower-level APIs directly, where the same facility is to be provided. The library has
therefore been designed to allow for efficient implementation (with a low abstraction
penalty) on most major platforms.

 Another goal of the C++ Standards Committee has been to ensure that C++ provides sufficient low-level facilities for those wishing to work close to the metal for the
ultimate performance. To this end, along with the new memory model comes a comprehensive atomic operations library for direct control over individual bits and bytes
and the inter-thread synchronization and visibility of any changes. These atomic types
and the corresponding operations can now be used in many places where developers
would previously have chosen to drop down to platform-specific assembly language.
Code  using  the  new  standard  types  and  operations  is  more  portable  and  easier  to
maintain.

 The C++ Standard Library also provides higher-level abstractions and facilities that
make writing multithreaded code easier and less error-prone. Sometimes the use of
these  facilities  comes  with  a  performance  cost  because  of  the  additional  code  that

must be executed. But this performance cost doesn’t necessarily imply a higher abstraction  penalty;  in  general,  the  cost  is  no  higher  than  would  be  incurred  by  writing
equivalent  functionality  by  hand,  and  the  compiler  may  inline  much  of  the  additional code anyway.

 In some cases, the high-level facilities provide additional functionality beyond what
may be required for a specific use. Most of the time this isn’t an issue: you don’t pay
for what you don’t use. On rare occasions, this unused functionality will impact the
performance of other code. If you’re aiming for performance and the cost is too high,
you may be better off handcrafting the desired functionality from lower-level facilities.
In the vast majority of cases, the additional complexity and chance of errors far outweigh  the  potential  benefits  from  a  small  performance  gain.  Even  if  profiling  does
demonstrate that the bottleneck is in the C++ Standard Library facilities, it may be due
to poor application design rather than a poor library implementation. For example, if
too many threads are competing for a mutex, it will impact the performance significantly. Rather than trying to shave a small fraction of time off the mutex operations, it
would probably be more beneficial to restructure the application so that there’s less
contention on the mutex. Designing applications to reduce contention is covered in

  In  those  rare  cases  where  the  C++  Standard  Library  doesn’t  provide  the  performance or behavior required, it might be necessary to use platform-specific facilities.

### 1.3.5 Platform-specific facilities

Although  the  C++  Thread  Library  provides  reasonably  comprehensive  facilities  for
multithreading and concurrency, on any given platform there will be platform-specific
facilities that go beyond what’s offered. In order to gain easy access to those facilities
without giving up the benefits of using the Standard C++ Thread Library, the types in
the C++ Thread Library may offer a  native_handle() member function that allows
the underlying implementation to be directly manipulated using a platform-specific
API.  By  its  nature,  any  operations  performed  using  native_handle()  are  entirely
platform dependent and beyond of the scope of this book (and the Standard C++
Library itself).

 Before even considering using platform-specific facilities, it’s important to understand what the Standard Library provides, so let’s get started with an example.

## 1.4 Getting started

OK, so you have a nice, shiny C++11/C++14/C++17 compiler. What’s next? What does
a multithreaded C++ program look like? It looks much like any other C++ program,
with the usual mix of variables, classes, and functions. The only real distinction is that
some functions might be running concurrently, so you need to ensure that shared
data is safe for concurrent access, as described in chapter 3. In order to run functions concurrently, specific functions and objects must be used to manage the different threads.

### 1.4.1 Hello, Concurrent World

Let’s start with a classic example: a program to print “Hello World.” A simple Hello
World program that runs in a single thread is shown here, to serve as a baseline when
we move to multiple threads:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout<<"Hello World\n";
}
```

All this program does is write “Hello World” to the standard output stream. Let’s compare it to the simple Hello Concurrent World program shown in the following listing,
which starts a separate thread to display the message.

Listing 1.1 A simple Hello Concurrent World program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
void hello()
{
    std::cout<<"Hello Concurrent World\n";
}
int main()
{
    std::thread t(hello);   3
    t.join();
}
```

The first difference is the extra  #include  <thread>. The declarations for the multithreading support in the Standard C++ Library are in new headers: the functions and
classes for managing threads are declared in <thread>, whereas those for protecting
shared data are declared in other headers.

 Second, the code for writing the message has been moved to a separate function.
This is because every thread has to have an initial function, where the new thread of
execution  begins.  For  the  initial  thread  in  an  application,  this  is  main(),  but  for
every other thread it’s specified in the constructor of a std::thread object—in this
case,  the  std::thread  object  named  t  has  the  new  hello()  function  as  its  initial
function.

 This is the next difference: rather than writing directly to standard output or calling hello() from main(), this program launches a new thread to do it, bringing the
thread count to two—the initial thread that starts at main() and the new thread that
starts at hello().

 After the new thread has been launched, the initial thread continues execution. If
it  didn’t  wait  for  the  new  thread  to  finish,  it  would  merrily  continue  to  the  end  of
main() and end the program—possibly before the new thread had a chance to run.
This is why the call to join() is there—as described in chapter 2, this causes the calling

### Summary

thread (in main()) to wait for the thread associated with the std::thread object, in
this case, t.

  If  this  seems  like  a  lot  of  effort  to  write  a  message  to  standard  output,  it  is—as
described in section 1.2.3, it’s generally not worth the effort to use multiple threads
for such a simple task, especially if the initial thread has nothing to do in the meantime.  Later  in  the  book,  you’ll  work  through  examples  of  scenarios  where  there’s  a
clear gain to using multiple threads.

### Summary

In this chapter, I covered what’s meant by concurrency and multithreading and why
you’d choose to use it (or not) in your applications. I also covered the history of multithreading in C++, from the complete lack of support in the 1998 standard, through
various platform-specific extensions, to proper multithreading support in the C++11
Standard, and on to the C++14 and C++17 standards and the Technical Specification
for concurrency. This support has come in time to allow programmers to take advantage  of  the  greater  hardware  concurrency  becoming  available  with  newer  CPUs,  as
chip  manufacturers  choose  to  add  more  processing  power  in  the  form  of  multiple
cores that allow more tasks to be executed concurrently, rather than increasing the
execution speed of a single core.

 I also showed how simple using the classes and functions from the C++ Standard
Library  can  be  in  the  examples  in  section  1.4.  In  C++,  using  multiple  threads  isn’t
complicated  in  and  of  itself;  the  complexity  lies  in  designing  the  code  so  that  it
behaves as intended.

 After the examples of section 1.4, it’s time for something with a bit more substance.

In chapter 2, we’ll look at the classes and functions available for managing threads.
