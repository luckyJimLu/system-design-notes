# Chapter 5: The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types

112 CHAPTER 4 Synchronizing concurrent operations
```cpp
try{
update_display(info_to_display.get());
} catch(std::exception& e){
display_error(e);
}
});
}
```

Note how each continuation takes a std::experimental::future as the sole parameter, and then uses .get() to retrieve the contained value. This means that exceptions
get propagated all the way down the chain, so the call to info_to_display.get() in
the final continuation will throw if any of the functions in the chain threw an exception, and the catch block here can handle all the exceptions, just like the catch block
in listing 4.18 did.
If the function calls to the backend block internally because they’re waiting for
messages to cross the network or for a database operation to complete, then you’re
not done yet. You may have split the task into its individual parts, but they’re still
blocking calls, so you still get blocked threads. What you need is for the backend calls
to return futures that become ready when the data is ready, without blocking any
threads. In this case, backend.async_authenticate_user(username,password) will
```cpp
now return a std::experimental::future<user_id> rather than a plain user_id.
```

You might think this would complicate the code, because returning a future from a
continuation would give you future<future<some_value>>, or else you’d have to put
the .then calls inside the continuations. Thankfully, if you thought that, then you’d be
mistaken: the continuation support has a nifty feature called future-unwrapping. If the
continuation function you pass to a .then() call returns a future<some_type>, then the
.then() call will return a future<some_type> in turn. This means your final code looks
like the next listing, and there is no blocking in your asynchronous function chain.
Listing4.21 A function to process user login with fully asynchronous operations
```cpp
std::experimental::future<void> process_login(
std::string const& username,std::string const& password)
{
return backend.async_authenticate_user(username,password).then(
[](std::experimental::future<user_id> id){
return backend.async_request_current_info(id.get());
}).then([](std::experimental::future<user_data> info_to_display){
try{
update_display(info_to_display.get());
} catch(std::exception& e){
display_error(e);
}
});
}
```

This is almost as straightforward as the sequential code from listing 4.18, with a little bit
more boilerplate around the .then calls and the lambda declarations. If your compiler

Using synchronization of operations to simplify code 113
supports C++14 generic lambdas, then the types of the futures in the lambda parameters can be replaced with auto, which simplifies the code even further:
```cpp
return backend.async_authenticate_user(username,password).then(
[](auto id){
return backend.async_request_current_info(id.get());
});
```

If you need anything more complex than simple linear control flow, then you can
implement this by putting the logic in one of the lambdas; for truly complex control
flow you probably need to write a separate function.
So far, we’ve focused on the continuation support in std::experimental::future.
```cpp
As you might expect, std::experimental::shared_future also supports continuations.
```

The difference here is that std::experimental::shared_future objects can have more
than one continuation, and the continuation parameter is a std::experimental::
```cpp
shared_future rather than a std::experimental::future. This naturally falls out of
```

the shared nature of std::experimental::shared_future—because multiple objects
can refer to the same shared state, if only one continuation was allowed, there would
be a race condition between two threads that were each trying to add continuations to
their own std::experimental::shared_future objects. This is obviously undesirable, so multiple continuations are permitted. Once you have multiple continuations
permitted, you may as well allow them to be added via the same std::experimental::
shared_future instance, rather than only allowing one continuation per object. In
addition, you can’t package the shared state in a one-shot std::experimental::
future passed to the first continuation, when you’re going to want to also pass it to
the second continuation. Thus the parameter passed to the continuation function
```cpp
must also be a std::experimental::shared_future:
auto fut=spawn_async(some_function).share();
auto fut2=fut.then([](std::experimental::shared_future<some_data> data){
do_stuff(data);
});
auto fut3=fut.then([](std::experimental::shared_future<some_data> data){
return do_other_stuff(data);
});
```

fut is a std::experimental::shared_future due to the share() call, so the continuation function must take a std::experimental::shared_future as its parameter.
However, the return value from the continuation is a plain std::experimental::
future—that value isn’t currently shared until you do something to share it—so both
```cpp
fut2 and fut3 are std::experimental::futures.
```

Continuations aren’t the only enhancement to futures in the Concurrency TS,
though they are probably the most important. Also provided are two overloaded functions that allow you to wait for either any one of a bunch of futures to become ready, or
all of a bunch of futures to become ready.

114 CHAPTER 4 Synchronizing concurrent operations
### 4.4.5 Waiting for more than one future

Suppose you have a large volume of data to process, and each item can be processed
independently. This is a prime opportunity to make use of the available hardware by
spawning a set of asynchronous tasks to process the data items, each of them returning the processed data via a future. However, if you need to wait for all the tasks to
finish and then gather all the results for some final processing, this can be inconvenient—you have to wait for each future in turn, and then gather the results. If you
want to do the result gathering with another asynchronous task, then you either have
to spawn it up front so it is occupying a thread that’s waiting, or you have to keep polling the futures and spawn the new task when all the futures are ready. An example of
such code is shown in the following listing.
```cpp
Listing4.22 Gathering results from futures using std::async
std::future<FinalResult> process_data(std::vector<MyData>& vec)
{
size_t const chunk_size=whatever;
std::vector<std::future<ChunkResult>> results;
for(auto begin=vec.begin(),end=vec.end();beg!=end;){
size_t const remaining_size=end-begin;
size_t const this_chunk_size=std::min(remaining_size,chunk_size);
results.push_back(
std::async(process_chunk,begin,begin+this_chunk_size));
begin+=this_chunk_size;
}
return std::async([all_results=std::move(results)](){
std::vector<ChunkResult> v;
v.reserve(all_results.size());
for(auto& f: all_results)
{
```

b
```cpp
v.push_back(f.get());
}
return gather_results(v);
});
}
```

This code spawns a new asynchronous task to wait for the results, and then processes
them when they are all available. However, because it waits for each task individually, it
B
will repeatedly be woken by the scheduler at as each result becomes available, and
then go back to sleep again when it finds another result that is not yet ready. Not only
does this occupy the thread doing the waiting, but it adds additional context switches
as each future becomes ready, which adds additional overhead.
With std::experimental::when_all, this waiting and switching can be avoided.
You pass the set of futures to be waited on to when_all, and it returns a new future
that becomes ready when all the futures in the set are ready. This future can then be
used with continuations to schedule additional work when the all the futures are
ready. See, for example, the next listing.

Using synchronization of operations to simplify code 115
```cpp
Listing4.23 Gathering results from futures using std::experimental::when_all
std::experimental::future<FinalResult> process_data(
std::vector<MyData>& vec)
{
size_t const chunk_size=whatever;
std::vector<std::experimental::future<ChunkResult>> results;
for(auto begin=vec.begin(),end=vec.end();beg!=end;){
size_t const remaining_size=end-begin;
size_t const this_chunk_size=std::min(remaining_size,chunk_size);
results.push_back(
spawn_async(
process_chunk,begin,begin+this_chunk_size));
begin+=this_chunk_size;
}
return std::experimental::when_all(
```

b
results.begin(),results.end()).then(
```cpp
[](std::future<std::vector<
std::experimental::future<ChunkResult>>> ready_results)
{
std::vector<std::experimental::future<ChunkResult>>
all_results=ready_results .get();
std::vector<ChunkResult> v;
v.reserve(all_results.size());
for(auto& f: all_results)
{
v.push_back(f.get());
}
return gather_results(v);
});
}
```

In this case, you use when_all to wait for all the futures to become ready, and then
B
schedule the function using .then rather than async . Though the lambda is superficially the same, it takes the results vector as a parameter (wrapped in a future)
rather than as a capture, and the calls to get on the futures at do not block, as all
the values are ready by the time execution gets there. This has the potential to reduce
the load on the system for little change to the code.
To complement when_all, we also have when_any. This creates a future that
becomes ready when any of the supplied futures becomes ready. This works well for
scenarios where you’ve spawned multiple tasks to take advantage of the available concurrency, but need to do something when the first one becomes ready.
### 4.4.6 Waiting for the first future in a set with when_any

Suppose you are searching a large dataset for a value that meets particular criteria, but
if there are multiple such values, then any will do. This is a prime target for parallelism—you can spawn multiple threads, each of which checks a subset of the data; if a
given thread finds a suitable value, then it sets a flag indicating that the other threads
should stop their search, and then sets the final return value. In this case, you want to

116 CHAPTER 4 Synchronizing concurrent operations
do the further processing when the first task completes its search, even if the other
tasks haven’t finished cleaning up yet.
Here, you can use std::experimental::when_any to gather the futures together,
and provide a new future that is ready when at least one of the original set is ready.
Whereas when_all gave you a future that wrapped the collection of futures you passed
in, when_any adds a further layer, combining the collection with an index value that
indicates which future triggered the combined future to be ready into an instance of
```cpp
the std::experimental::when_any_result class template.
```

An example of using when_any as described here is shown in the next listing.
```cpp
Listing4.24 Using std::experimental::when_any to process the first value found
std::experimental::future<FinalResult>
find_and_process_value(std::vector<MyData> &data)
{
unsigned const concurrency = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
unsigned const num_tasks = (concurrency > 0) ? concurrency : 2;
std::vector<std::experimental::future<MyData *>> results;
auto const chunk_size = (data.size() + num_tasks - 1) / num_tasks;
auto chunk_begin = data.begin();
std::shared_ptr<std::atomic<bool>> done_flag =
std::make_shared<std::atomic<bool>>(false);
```

b
```cpp
for (unsigned i = 0; i < num_tasks; ++i) {
auto chunk_end =
(i < (num_tasks - 1)) ? chunk_begin + chunk_size : data.end();
results.push_back(spawn_async([=] {
for (auto entry = chunk_begin; c
!*done_flag && (entry != chunk_end);
++entry) {
if (matches_find_criteria(*entry)) {
*done_flag = true;
return &*entry;
}
}
return (MyData *)nullptr;
}));
chunk_begin = chunk_end;
}
std::shared_ptr<std::experimental::promise<FinalResult>> final_result =
std::make_shared<std::experimental::promise<FinalResult>>();
struct DoneCheck {
std::shared_ptr<std::experimental::promise<FinalResult>>
```

final_result;
DoneCheck(
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<std::experimental::promise<FinalResult>>
```

final_result_)
```cpp
: final_result(std::move(final_result_)) {}
```

e
```cpp
void operator()(
std::experimental::future<std::experimental::when_any_result<
std::vector<std::experimental::future<MyData *>>>>

Using synchronization of operations to simplify code 117
results_param) {
auto results = results_param.get();
MyData *const ready_result =
- results.futures[results.index].get();
if (ready_result)
```

g
final_result->set_value(
```cpp
process_found_value(*ready_result));
else {
results.futures.erase(
```

h
```cpp
results.futures.begin() + results.index);
if (!results.futures.empty()) {
std::experimental::when_any(
results.futures.begin(), results.futures.end())
.then(std::move(*this));
} else {
final_result->set_exception(
```

j
```cpp
std::make_exception_ptr(
std::runtime_error(“Not found”)));
}
}
```

};
```cpp
std::experimental::when_any(results.begin(), results.end())
.then(DoneCheck(final_result));
```

1)
```cpp
return final_result->get_future();
}
```

B
The initial loop spawns off num_tasks asynchronous tasks, each running the
lambda function from . This lambda captures by copying, so each task will have its
own values for chunk_begin and chunk_end, as well as a copy of the shared pointer,
done_flag. This avoids any concerns over lifetime issues.
Once all the tasks have been spawned, you want to handle the case that a task
returned. This is done by chaining a continuation on the when_any call . This time
you write the continuation as a class because you want to reuse it recursively. When
e
one of the initial tasks is ready, the DoneCheck function call operator is invoked .
- First, it extracts the value from the future that is ready , and then if the value was
g
found, you process it and set the final result . Otherwise, you drop the ready future
h
from the collection , and if there are still more futures to check, issue a new call to
when_any , that will trigger its continuation when the next future is ready. If there
are no futures left, then none of them found the value, so store an exception instead
j 1)
. The return value of the function is the future for the final result . There are
alternative ways to solve this problem, but I hope this shows how one might use
when_any.
Both these examples of using when_all and when_any have used the iterator-range
overloads, which take a pair of iterators denoting the beginning and end of a set of
futures to wait for. Both functions also come in variadic forms, where they accept a
number of futures directly as parameters to the function. In this case, the result is a
future holding a tuple (or a when_any_result holding a tuple) rather than a vector:

118 CHAPTER 4 Synchronizing concurrent operations
```cpp
std::experimental::future<int> f1=spawn_async(func1);
std::experimental::future<std::string> f2=spawn_async(func2);
std::experimental::future<double> f3=spawn_async(func3);
std::experimental::future<
std::tuple<
std::experimental::future<int>,
std::experimental::future<std::string>,
std::experimental::future<double>>> result=
std::experimental::when_all(std::move(f1),std::move(f2),std::move(f3));
```

This example highlights something important about all the uses of when_any and
when_all—they always move from any std::experimental::futures passed in via a
container, and they take their parameters by value, so you have to explicitly move the
futures in, or pass temporaries.
Sometimes the event that you’re waiting for is for a set of threads to reach a particular point in the code, or to have processed a certain number of data items between
them. In these cases, you might be better served using a latch or a barrier rather than a
future. Let’s look at the latches and barriers that are provided by the Concurrency TS.
### 4.4.7 Latches and barriers in the Concurrency TS

First off, let’s consider what is meant when we talk of a latch or a barrier. A latch is a synchronization object that becomes ready when its counter is decremented to zero. Its
name comes from the fact that it latches the output—once it is ready, it stays ready
until it is destroyed. A latch is thus a lightweight facility for waiting for a series of
events to occur.
On the other hand, a barrier is a reusable synchronization component used for
internal synchronization between a set of threads. Whereas a latch doesn’t care which
threads decrement the counter—the same thread can decrement the counter multiple times, or multiple threads can each decrement the counter once, or some combination of the two—with barriers, each thread can only arrive at the barrier once per
cycle. When threads arrive at the barrier, they block until all of the threads involved
have arrived at the barrier, at which point they are all released. The barrier can then
be reused—the threads can then arrive at the barrier again to wait for all the threads
for the next cycle.
Latches are inherently simpler than barriers, so let’s start with the latch type from
```cpp
the Concurrency TS: std::experimental::latch.
4.4.8 A basic latch type: std::experimental::latch
```

std::experimental::latch comes from the <experimental/latch> header. When
you construct a std::experimental::latch, you specify the initial counter value as
the one and only argument to the constructor. Then, as the events that you are waiting for occur, you call count_down on your latch object, and the latch becomes ready
when that count reaches zero. If you need to wait for the latch to become ready, then
you can call wait on the latch; if you only need to check if it is ready, then you can call

Using synchronization of operations to simplify code 119
is_ready. Finally, if you need to both count down the counter and then wait for the
counter to reach zero, you can call count_down_and_wait. A basic example is shown
in the following listing.
```cpp
Listing4.25 Waiting for events with std::experimental::latch
void foo(){
unsigned const thread_count=...;
```

b
```cpp
latch done(thread_count);
```

my_data data[thread_count];
```cpp
std::vector<std::future<void> > threads;
for(unsigned i=0;i<thread_count;++i)
threads.push_back(std::async(std::launch::async,[&,i]{
data[i]=make_data(i);
done.count_down();
```

e
```cpp
do_more_stuff();
}));
- done.wait();
```

g
```cpp
process_data(data,thread_count);
}
```

h
B
This constructs done with the number of events that you need to wait for , and then
```cpp
spawns the appropriate number of threads using std::async . Each thread then
```

counts down the latch when it has generated the relevant chunk of data before
e
continuing on with further processing . The main thread can wait for all the data to
- g
be ready by waiting on the latch before processing the generated data . The data
g
processing at will potentially run concurrently with the final processing steps of
e
each thread —there is no guarantee that the threads have all completed until the
h
std::future destructors run at the end of the function .
One thing to note is that the lambda passed to std::async at captures everything by reference except i, which is captured by value. This is because i is the loop
counter, and capturing that by reference would cause a data race and undefined
behavior, whereas data and done are things you need to share access to. Also, you only
need a latch at all in this scenario because the threads have additional processing to
do after the data is ready; otherwise you could wait for all the futures to ensure the
tasks were complete before processing the data.
g
It is safe to access data in the process_data call , even though it is stored by
tasks running in other threads, because the latch is a synchronization object, so
changes visible to a thread that call count_down are guaranteed to be visible to a
thread that returns from a call to wait on the same latch object. Formally, the call to
count_down synchronizes with the call to wait—we’ll see what that means when we look
at the low-level memory ordering and synchronization constraints in chapter 5.
Alongside latches, the Concurrency TS gives us barriers—reusable synchronization
objects for synchronizing a group of threads. Let’s look at those next.

120 CHAPTER 4 Synchronizing concurrent operations
### 4.4.9 std::experimental::barrier: a basic barrier

The Concurrency TS provides two types of barriers in the <experimental/barrier>
```cpp
header: std::experimental::barrier and std::experimental::flex_barrier. The
```

former is more basic, and potentially therefore has lower overhead, whereas the latter
is more flexible, but potentially has more overhead.
Suppose you have a group of threads that are operating on some data. Each thread
can do its processing on the data independently of the others, so no synchronization
is needed during the processing, but all the threads must have completed their processing before the next data item can be processed, or before the subsequent processing can be done. std::experimental::barrier is targeted at precisely this scenario.
You construct a barrier with a count specifying the number of threads involved in the
synchronization group. As each thread is done with its processing, it arrives at the barrier and waits for the rest of the group by calling arrive_and_wait on the barrier
object. When the last thread in the group arrives, all the threads are released, and the
barrier is reset. The threads in the group can then resume their processing and either
process the next data item or proceed with the next stage of processing, as appropriate.
Whereas latches latch, so once they are ready they stay ready, barriers do not—barriers release the waiting threads and then reset so they can be used again. They also
only synchronize within a group of threads—a thread cannot wait for a barrier to be
ready unless it is one of the threads in the synchronization group. Threads can explicitly drop out of the group by calling arrive_and_drop on the barrier, in which case
that thread cannot wait for the barrier to be ready anymore, and the count of threads
that must arrive in the next cycle is one less than the number of threads that had to
arrive in the current cycle.
```cpp
Listing4.26 Using std::experimental::barrier
result_chunk process(data_chunk);
std::vector<data_chunk>
divide_into_chunks(data_block data, unsigned num_threads);
void process_data(data_source &source, data_sink &sink) {
unsigned const concurrency = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
unsigned const num_threads = (concurrency > 0) ? concurrency : 2;
std::experimental::barrier sync(num_threads);
std::vector<joining_thread> threads(num_threads);
std::vector<data_chunk> chunks;
```

result_block result;
```cpp
for (unsigned i = 0; i < num_threads; ++i) {
```

g
```cpp
threads[i] = joining_thread([&, i] {
while (!source.done()) {
```

b
```cpp
if (!i) {
data_block current_block =
source.get_next_data_block();

Using synchronization of operations to simplify code 121
chunks = divide_into_chunks(
current_block, num_threads);
}
sync.arrive_and_wait();
result.set_chunk(i, num_threads, process(chunks[i]));
sync.arrive_and_wait();
if (!i) { e
sink.write_data(std::move(result)); f
}
}
});
}
```

h
```cpp
}
```

Listing 4.26 shows an example of using a barrier to synchronize a group of threads.
You have data coming from source, and you’re writing the output to sink, but in
order to make use of the available concurrency in the system, you’re splitting each
block of data into num_threads chunks. This has to be done serially, so you have an
B
initial block that only runs on the thread for which i==0. All threads then wait on
the barrier for that serial code to complete before you reach the parallel region,
where each thread processes its individual chunk and updates the result with that
e
before synchronizing again . You then have a second serial region where only
- thread 0 writes the result out to the sink . All threads then keep looping until the
g
source reports that everything is done . Note that as each thread loops round, the
serial section at the bottom of the loop combines with the section at the top; because
only thread 0 has anything to do in either of these sections, this is OK, and all the
threads will synchronize together at the first use of the barrier . When all the processing is done, then all the threads will exit the loop, and the destructors for the
joining_thread objects will wait for them all to finish at the end of the outer funch
tion (joining_thread was introduced in chapter 2, listing 2.7).
The key thing to note here is that the calls to arrive_and_wait are at the points in
the code where it is important that no threads proceed until all threads are ready. At
the first synchronization point, all the threads are waiting for thread 0 to arrive, but
the use of the barrier provides you with a clean line in the sand. At the second synchronization point, you have the reverse situation: it is thread 0 that is waiting for all
the other threads to arrive before it can write out the completed result to the sink.
The Concurrency TS doesn’t just give you one barrier type; as well as std::experimental::barrier, you also get std::experimental::flex_barrier, which is more flexible. One of the ways that it is more flexible is that it allows for a final serial region to be
run when all threads have arrived at the barrier, before they are all released again.
### 4.4.10 std::experimental::flex_barrier—std::experimental::barrier’s

flexible friend
The interface to std::experimental::flex_barrier differs from that of std::
experimental::barrier in only one way: there is an additional constructor that takes

122 CHAPTER 4 Synchronizing concurrent operations
a completion function, as well as a thread count. This function is run on exactly one
of the threads that arrived at the barrier, once all the threads have arrived at the barrier. Not only does it provide a means of specifying a chunk of code that must be run
serially, it also provides a means of changing the number of threads that must arrive at
the barrier for the next cycle. The thread count can be changed to any number,
whether higher or lower than the previous count; it is up to the programmer who uses
this facility to ensure that the correct number of threads will arrive at the barrier the
next time round.
The following listing shows how listing 4.26 could be rewritten to use std::
experimental::flex_barrier to manage the serial region.
```cpp
Listing4.27 Using std::flex_barrier to provide a serial region
void process_data(data_source &source, data_sink &sink) {
unsigned const concurrency = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
unsigned const num_threads = (concurrency > 0) ? concurrency : 2;
std::vector<data_chunk> chunks;
```

b
```cpp
auto split_source = [&] {
if (!source.done()) {
data_block current_block = source.get_next_data_block();
chunks = divide_into_chunks(current_block, num_threads);
}
```

};
```cpp
split_source();
```

result_block result;
```cpp
std::experimental::flex_barrier sync(num_threads, [&] {
sink.write_data(std::move(result));
```

e
```cpp
split_source();
- return -1;
});
std::vector<joining_thread> threads(num_threads);
for (unsigned i = 0; i < num_threads; ++i) {
```

g
```cpp
threads[i] = joining_thread([&, i] {
while (!source.done()) {
result.set_chunk(i, num_threads, process(chunks[i]));
sync.arrive_and_wait();
} h
});
}
}
```

The first difference between this code and listing 4.26 is that you’ve extracted a
B
lambda that splits the next data block into chunks . This is called before you start
, and encapsulates the code that was run on thread 0 at the start of each iteration.

### Summary 123

The second difference is that your sync object is now a std::experimental::flex
_barrier, and you are passing a completion function as well as a thread count .
This completion function is run on one thread after each thread has arrived, and so
can encapsulate the code that was to be run on thread 0 at the end of each iteration,
and then there’s a call to your newly-extracted split_source lambda that would have
e - been called at the start of the next iteration . The return value of -1 indicates that
the number of participating threads is to remain unchanged; a return value of zero or
more would specify the number of participating threads in the next cycle.
g
The main loop is now simplified: it only contains the parallel portion of the
h
code, and thus only needs a single synchronization point . The use of std::
experimental::flex_barrier has thus simplified the code.
The use of the completion function to provide a serial section is quite powerful, as
is the ability to change the number of participating threads. For example, this could
be used by pipeline style code where the number of threads is less during the initial
priming of the pipeline and the final draining of the pipeline than it is during the
main processing, when all the stages of the pipeline are operating.
### Summary

Synchronizing operations between threads is an important part of writing an application that uses concurrency: if there’s no synchronization, the threads are essentially
independent and might as well be written as separate applications that are run as a
group because of their related activities. In this chapter, I’ve covered various ways of
synchronizing operations from the basic condition variables, through futures, promises, packaged tasks, latches, and barriers. I’ve also discussed ways of approaching the
synchronization issues: functional-style programming, where each task produces a
result entirely dependent on its input rather than on the external environment; message passing, where communication between threads is via asynchronous messages
sent through a messaging subsystem that acts as an intermediary; and continuation
style, where the follow-on tasks for each operation are specified, and the system takes
care of the scheduling.
Having discussed many of the high-level facilities available in C++, it’s now time to
look at the low-level facilities that make it all work: the C++ memory model and atomic
operations.

The C++ memory model
and operations on
atomic types
This chapter covers
- The details of the C++ memory model
- The atomic types provided by the C++
- Standard Library
- The operations that are available on those types
- How those operations can be used to provide
synchronization between threads
One of the most important features of the C++ Standard is something most programmers won’t even notice. It’s not the new syntax features, nor is it the new
library facilities, but the new multithreading-aware memory model. Without the
memory model to define exactly how the fundamental building blocks work, none
of the facilities I’ve covered could be relied on to work. There’s a reason that most
programmers won’t notice: if you use mutexes to protect your data and condition
variables, futures, latches, or barriers to signal events, the details of why they work
aren’t important. It’s only when you start trying to get “close to the machine” that
the precise details of the memory model matter.
Whatever else it is, C++ is a systems programming language. One of the goals of
the Standards Committee is that there will be no need for a lower-level language

Memory model basics 125
than C++. Programmers should be provided with enough flexibility within C++ to do
whatever they need without the language getting in the way, allowing them to get
“close to the machine” when the need arises. The atomic types and operations allow
just that, providing facilities for low-level synchronization operations that will commonly reduce to one or two CPU instructions.
In this chapter, I’ll start by covering the basics of the memory model, then move on
to the atomic types and operations, and finally cover the various types of synchronization available with the operations on atomic types. This is quite complex: unless you’re
planning on writing code that uses the atomic operations for synchronization (such as
the lock-free data structures in chapter 7), you won’t need to know these details.
Let’s ease into things with a look at the basics of the memory model.
## 5.1 Memory model basics

There are two aspects to the memory model: the basic structural aspects, which
relate to how things are laid out in memory, and the concurrency aspects. The structural aspects are important for concurrency, particularly when you’re looking at lowlevel atomic operations, so I’ll start with those. In C++, it’s all about objects and
memory locations.
### 5.1.1 Objects and memory locations

All data in a C++ program is made up of objects. This is not to say that you can create a
new class derived from int, or that the fundamental types have member functions, or
any of the other consequences often implied when people say “everything is an object”
when discussing a language like Smalltalk or Ruby. It’s a statement about the building
blocks of data in C++. The C++ Standard defines an object as “a region of storage,”
although it goes on to assign properties to these objects, such as their type and lifetime.
Some of these objects are simple values of a fundamental type such as int or
float, whereas others are instances of user-defined classes. Some objects (such as
arrays, instances of derived classes, and instances of classes with non-static data
members) have sub-objects, but others don’t.
Whatever its type, an object is stored in one or more memory locations. Each memory location is either an object (or sub-object) of a scalar type such as unsigned short
or my_class* or a sequence of adjacent bit fields. If you use bit fields, this is an
important point to note: though adjacent bit fields are distinct objects, they’re still
counted as the same memory location. Figure 5.1 shows how a struct divides into
objects and memory locations.
First, the entire struct is one object that consists of several sub-objects, one for
each data member. The bf1 and bf2 bit fields share a memory location, and the
```cpp
std::string object, s, consists of several memory locations internally, but otherwise
```

each member has its own memory location. Note how the zero-length bit field bf3
(the name is commented out because zero-length bit fields must be unnamed) separates bf4 into its own memory location, but doesn't have a memory location itself.

Figure 5.1 The division of a struct into objects and memory locations
There are four important things to take away from this:
- Every variable is an object, including those that are members of other objects.
- Every object occupies at least one memory location.
- Variables of fundamental types such as int or char occupy exactly one memory
location, whatever their size, even if they’re adjacent or part of an array.
- Adjacent bit fields are part of the same memory location.
I’m sure you’re wondering what this has to do with concurrency, so let’s take a look.
### 5.1.2 Objects, memory locations, and concurrency

Now, here’s the part that’s crucial for multithreaded applications in C++: everything
hinges on those memory locations. If two threads access separate memory locations,
there’s no problem: everything works fine. On the other hand, if two threads access
the same memory location, then you have to be careful. If neither thread is updating
the memory location, you’re fine; read-only data doesn’t need protection or synchronization. If either thread is modifying the data, there’s a potential for a race condition, as described in chapter 3.
In order to avoid the race condition, there has to be an enforced ordering
between the accesses in the two threads. This could be a fixed ordering such that one
access is always before the other, or it could be an ordering that varies between runs of
the application, but guarantees that there is some defined ordering. One way to ensure
there’s a defined ordering is to use mutexes as described in chapter 3; if the same
mutex is locked prior to both accesses, only one thread can access the memory location

Memory model basics 127
at a time, so one must happen before the other (though, in general, you can't know in
advance which will be first). The other way is to use the synchronization properties of
atomic operations (see section 5.2 for the definition of atomic operations) either on
the same or other memory locations to enforce an ordering between the accesses in
the two threads. The use of atomic operations to enforce an ordering is described
in section 5.3. If more than two threads access the same memory location, each pair of
accesses must have a defined ordering.
If there’s no enforced ordering between two accesses to a single memory location
from separate threads, one or both of those accesses is not atomic, and if one or both
is a write, then this is a data race and causes undefined behavior.
This statement is crucially important: undefined behavior is one of the nastiest corners of C++. According to the language standard, once an application contains any
undefined behavior, all bets are off; the behavior of the complete application is now
undefined, and it may do anything at all. I know of one case where a particular
instance of undefined behavior caused someone’s monitor to catch fire. Although this
is rather unlikely to happen to you, a data race is definitely a serious bug and should
be avoided at all costs.
There’s another important point in that statement: you can also avoid the undefined behavior by using atomic operations to access the memory location involved
in the race. This doesn’t prevent the race itself—which of the atomic operations
touches the memory location first is still not specified—but it does bring the program
back into the realm of defined behavior.
Before we look at atomic operations, there’s one more concept that’s important to
understand about objects and memory locations: modification orders.
### 5.1.3 Modification orders

Every object in a C++ program has a modification order composed of all the writes to
that object from all threads in the program, starting with the object’s initialization. In
most cases this order will vary between runs, but in any given execution of the program all threads in the system must agree on the order. If the object in question isn’t
one of the atomic types described in section 5.2, you’re responsible for making certain
that there’s sufficient synchronization to ensure that threads agree on the modification order of each variable. If different threads see distinct sequences of values for a
single variable, you have a data race and undefined behavior (see section 5.1.2). If you
do use atomic operations, the compiler is responsible for ensuring that the necessary
synchronization is in place.
This requirement means that certain kinds of speculative execution aren’t permitted, because once a thread has seen a particular entry in the modification order, subsequent reads from that thread must return later values, and subsequent writes from
that thread to that object must occur later in the modification order. Also, a read of an
object that follows a write to that object in the same thread must either return the
value written or another value that occurs later in the modification order of that

128 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
object. Although all threads must agree on the modification orders of each individual
object in a program, they don’t necessarily have to agree on the relative order of operations on separate objects. See section 5.3.3 for more on the ordering of operations
between threads.
So, what constitutes an atomic operation, and how can these be used to enforce
ordering?
## 5.2 Atomic operations and types in C++

An atomic operation is an indivisible operation. You can’t observe such an operation
half-done from any thread in the system; it’s either done or not done. If the load operation that reads the value of an object is atomic, and all modifications to that object are
also atomic, that load will retrieve either the initial value of the object or the value
stored by one of the modifications.
The flip side of this is that a non-atomic operation might be seen as half-done by
another thread. If the non-atomic operation is composed of atomic operations (for
example, assignment to a struct with atomic members), then other threads may
observe some subset of the constituent atomic operations as complete, but others as
not yet started, so you might observe or end up with a value that is a mixed-up combination of the various values stored. In any case, unsynchronized accesses to nonatomic variables form a simple problematic race condition, as described in chapter 3,
but at this level it may constitute a data race (see section 5.1) and cause undefined
behavior.
In C++, you need to use an atomic type to get an atomic operation in most cases, so
let’s look at those.
### 5.2.1 The standard atomic types

The standard atomic types can be found in the <atomic> header. All operations on such
types are atomic, and only operations on these types are atomic in the sense of the language definition, although you can use mutexes to make other operations appear
atomic. In fact, the standard atomic types themselves might use such emulation: they
(almost) all have an is_lock_free() member function, which allows the user to determine whether operations on a given type are done directly with atomic instructions
(x.is_lock_free() returns true) or done by using a lock internal to the compiler
and library (x.is_lock_free() returns false).
This is important to know in many cases—the key use case for atomic operations is
as a replacement for an operation that would otherwise use a mutex for synchronization; if the atomic operations themselves use an internal mutex then the hoped-for
performance gains will probably not materialize, and you might be better off using
the easier-to-get-right mutex-based implementation instead. This is the case with lockfree data structures such as those discussed in chapter 7.
In fact, this is so important that the library provides a set of macros to identify at
compile time whether the atomic types for the various integral types are lock-free.

Atomic operations and types in C++ 129
Since C++17, all atomic types have a static constexpr member variable, X::is_
always_lock_free, which is true if and only if the atomic type X is lock-free for all
supported hardware that the output of the current compilation might run on. For
example, for a given target platform, std::atomic<int> might always be lock-free, so
std::atomic<int>::is_always_lock_free will be true, but std::atomic<uintmax_t>
might only be lock-free if the hardware the program ends up running on supports the
necessary instructions, so this is a run-time property, and std::atomic<uintmax_t>
::is_always_lock_free would be false when compiling for that platform.
The macros are ATOMIC_BOOL_LOCK_FREE, ATOMIC_CHAR_LOCK_FREE, ATOMIC_
CHAR16_T_LOCK_FREE, ATOMIC_CHAR32_T_LOCK_FREE, ATOMIC_WCHAR_T_LOCK_FREE,
ATOMIC_SHORT_LOCK_FREE, ATOMIC_INT_LOCK_FREE, ATOMIC_LONG_LOCK_FREE, ATOMIC
_LLONG_LOCK_FREE, and ATOMIC_POINTER_LOCK_FREE. They specify the lock-free status
of the corresponding atomic types for the specified built-in types and their unsigned
counterparts (LLONG refers to long long, and POINTER refers to all pointer types).
They evaluate to the value 0 if the atomic type is never lock-free, to the value 2 if the
atomic type is always lock-free, and to the value 1 if the lock-free status of the corresponding atomic type is a runtime property as described previously.
The only type that doesn’t provide an is_lock_free() member function is
std::atomic_flag. This type is a simple Boolean flag, and operations on this type are
required to be lock-free; once you have a simple lock-free Boolean flag, you can use that
to implement a simple lock and implement all the other atomic types using that as a
basis. When I said simple, I meant it: objects of the std::atomic_flag type are initialized to clear, and they can then either be queried and set (with the test_and_set()
member function) or cleared (with the clear() member function). That’s it: no
assignment, no copy construction, no test and clear, no other operations at all.
The remaining atomic types are all accessed through specializations of the
std::atomic<> class template and are a bit more full-featured but may not be lockfree (as explained previously). On most popular platforms it’s expected that the
atomic variants of all the built-in types (such as std::atomic<int> and std::atomic
<void*>) are indeed lock-free, but it isn’t required. As you’ll see shortly, the interface of each specialization reflects the properties of the type; bitwise operations
such as &= aren’t defined for plain pointers, so they aren’t defined for atomic pointers either, for example.
In addition to using the std::atomic<> class template directly, you can use the set
of names shown in table 5.1 to refer to the implementation-supplied atomic types.
Because of the history of how atomic types were added to the C++ Standard, if you
have an older compiler, these alternative type names may refer either to the corresponding std::atomic<> specialization or to a base class of that specialization,
whereas in a compiler that fully supports C++17, these are always aliases for the corresponding std::atomic<> specializations. Mixing these alternative names with the
direct naming of std::atomic<> specializations in the same program can therefore
lead to nonportable code.

```

As well as the basic atomic types, the C++ Standard Library also provides a set of
typedefs for the atomic types corresponding to the various non-atomic Standard
Library typedefs such as std::size_t. These are shown in table 5.2.

atomic_uintptr_t uintptr_t
atomic_size_t size_t
atomic_ptrdiff_t ptrdiff_t
atomic_intmax_t intmax_t
atomic_uintmax_t uintmax_t
That’s a lot of types! There’s a rather simple pattern to it; for a standard typedef T, the
corresponding atomic type is the same name with an atomic_ prefix: atomic_T. The
same applies to the built-in types, except that signed is abbreviated as s, unsigned as
u, and long long as llong. It’s generally simpler to say std::atomic<T> for whichever
T you want to work with, rather than use the alternative names.
The standard atomic types are not copyable or assignable in the conventional
sense, in that they have no copy constructors or copy assignment operators. They do,
however, support assignment from and implicit conversion to the corresponding
built-in types as well as direct load() and store() member functions, exchange(),
compare_exchange_weak(), and compare_exchange_strong(). They also support the
compound assignment operators where appropriate: +=, -=, *=, |=, and so on, and
the integral types and std::atomic<> specializations for ++ and -- pointers support.
These operators also have corresponding named member functions with the same
functionality: fetch_add(), fetch_or(), and so on. The return value from the assignment operators and member functions is either the value stored (in the case of the
assignment operators) or the value prior to the operation (in the case of the named
functions). This avoids the potential problems that could stem from the usual habit of
these assignment operators returning a reference to the object being assigned to. In
order to get the stored value from these references, the code would have to perform a
separate read, allowing another thread to modify the value between the assignment
and the read and opening the door for a race condition.

132 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
The std::atomic<> class template isn’t only a set of specializations, though. It
does have a primary template that can be used to create an atomic variant of a userdefined type. Because it’s a generic class template, the operations are limited to
load(), store() (and assignment from and conversion to the user-defined type),
exchange(), compare_exchange_weak(), and compare_exchange_strong().
Each of the operations on the atomic types has an optional memory-ordering argument which is one of the values of the std::memory_order enumeration. This argument is used to specify the required memory-ordering semantics. The std::memory
```cpp
_order enumeration has six possible values: std::memory_order_relaxed, std::
memory_order_acquire, std::memory_order_consume, std::memory_order_acq_rel,
std::memory_order_release, and std::memory_order_seq_cst.
```

The permitted values for the memory ordering depend on the operation category.
If you don't specify an ordering value, then the default ordering is used, which is the
strongest ordering: std::memory_order_seq_cst. The precise semantics of the memory-ordering options are covered in section 5.3. For now, it suffices to know that the
operations are divided into three categories:
- Store operations, which can have memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_release,
or memory_order_seq_cst ordering
- Load operations, which can have memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_consume,
memory_order_acquire, or memory_order_seq_cst ordering
- Read-modify-write operations, which can have memory_order_relaxed, memory_
order_consume, memory_order_acquire, memory_order_release, memory_order
_acq_rel, or memory_order_seq_cst ordering
Let’s now look at the operations you can perform on each of the standard atomic
```cpp
types, starting with std::atomic_flag.
5.2.2 Operations on std::atomic_flag
```

std::atomic_flag is the simplest standard atomic type, which represents a Boolean
flag. Objects of this type can be in one of two states: set or clear. It’s deliberately basic
and is intended as a building block only. As such, I’d never expect to see it in use,
except under special circumstances. Even so, it will serve as a starting point for discussing the other atomic types, because it shows some of the general policies that apply to
the atomic types.
Objects of the std::atomic_flag type must be initialized with ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT.
This initializes the flag to a clear state. There’s no choice in the matter; the flag always
starts clear:
```cpp
std::atomic_flag f=ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT;
```

This applies no matter where the object is declared and what scope it has. It’s the only
atomic type to require such special treatment for initialization, but it’s also the only
type guaranteed to be lock-free. If the std::atomic_flag object has static storage

Atomic operations and types in C++ 133
duration, it’s guaranteed to be statically initialized, which means that there are no
initialization-order issues; it will always be initialized by the time of the first operation
on the flag.
Once you have your flag object initialized, there are only three things you can do
with it: destroy it, clear it, or set it and query the previous value. These correspond
to the destructor, the clear() member function, and the test_and_set() member
function, respectively. Both the clear() and test_and_set() member functions
can have a memory order specified. clear() is a store operation and so can’t have
memory_order_acquire or memory_order_acq_rel semantics, but test_and_set()
is a read-modify-write operation and so can have any of the memory-ordering tags
applied. As with every atomic operation, the default for both is memory_order_seq_cst.
For example:
B
```cpp
f.clear(std::memory_order_release);
bool x=f.test_and_set();
```

B
Here, the call to clear() explicitly requests that the flag is cleared with release
semantics, whereas the call to test_and_set() uses the default memory ordering
for setting the flag and retrieving the old value.
You can’t copy-construct another std::atomic_flag object from the first, and
you can’t assign one std::atomic_flag to another. This isn’t something peculiar to
std::atomic_flag but something common with all the atomic types. All operations on
an atomic type are defined as atomic, and assignment and copy-construction involve two
objects. A single operation on two distinct objects can’t be atomic. In the case of copyconstruction or copy-assignment, the value must first be read from one object and then
written to the other. These are two separate operations on two separate objects, and the
combination can’t be atomic. Therefore, these operations aren’t permitted.
The limited feature set makes std::atomic_flag ideally suited to use as a spinlock mutex. Initially, the flag is clear and the mutex is unlocked. To lock the mutex,
loop on test_and_set() until the old value is false, indicating that this thread set the
value to true. Unlocking the mutex is simply a matter of clearing the flag. This implementation is shown in the following listing.
```cpp
Listing5.1 Implementation of a spinlock mutex using std::atomic_flag
class spinlock_mutex
{
std::atomic_flag flag;
```

public:
spinlock_mutex():
flag(ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT)
```cpp
{}
void lock()
{
while(flag.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire));
}
```

134 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
```cpp
void unlock()
{
flag.clear(std::memory_order_release);
}
```

};
This mutex is basic, but it’s enough to use with std::lock_guard<> (see chapter 3). By
its nature it does a busy-wait in lock(), so it’s a poor choice if you expect there to be any
degree of contention, but it’s enough to ensure mutual exclusion. When we look at the
memory-ordering semantics, you’ll see how this guarantees the necessary enforced
ordering that goes with a mutex lock. This example is covered in section 5.3.6.
std::atomic_flag is so limited that it can’t even be used as a general Boolean flag,
because it doesn’t have a simple nonmodifying query operation. For that you’re better
```cpp
off using std::atomic<bool>, so I’ll cover that next.
5.2.3 Operations on std::atomic<bool>
```

The most basic of the atomic integral types is std::atomic<bool>. This is a more fullfeatured Boolean flag than std::atomic_flag, as you might expect. Although it’s still
not copy-constructible or copy-assignable, you can construct it from a non-atomic
bool, so it can be initially true or false, and you can also assign to instances of
```cpp
std::atomic<bool> from a non-atomic bool:
std::atomic<bool> b(true);
b=false;
```

One other thing to note about the assignment operator from a non-atomic bool is
that it differs from the general convention of returning a reference to the object it’s
assigned to: it returns a bool with the value assigned instead. This is another common
pattern with the atomic types: the assignment operators they support return values (of
the corresponding non-atomic type) rather than references. If a reference to the
atomic variable was returned, any code that depended on the result of the assignment
would then have to explicitly load the value, potentially getting the result of a modification by another thread. By returning the result of the assignment as a non-atomic
value, you can avoid this additional load, and you know that the value obtained is the
value stored.
Rather than using the restrictive clear() function of std::atomic_flag, writes (of
either true or false) are done by calling store(), although the memory-order
semantics can still be specified. Similarly, test_and_set() has been replaced with the
more general exchange() member function that allows you to replace the stored
value with a new one of your choosing and atomically retrieve the original value.
std::atomic<bool> also supports a plain nonmodifying query of the value with an
implicit conversion to plain bool or with an explicit call to load(). As you might
expect, store() is a store operation, whereas load() is a load operation. exchange()
is a read-modify-write operation:

Atomic operations and types in C++ 135
```cpp
std::atomic<bool> b;
bool x=b.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
b.store(true);
x=b.exchange(false,std::memory_order_acq_rel);
exchange() isn’t the only read-modify-write operation supported by std::atomic<bool>;
```

it also introduces an operation to store a new value if the current value is equal to an
expected value.
STORING A NEW VALUE (OR NOT) DEPENDING ON THE CURRENT VALUE
This new operation is called compare-exchange, and it comes in the form of the
compare_exchange_weak() and compare_exchange_strong() member functions. The
compare-exchange operation is the cornerstone of programming with atomic types;
it compares the value of the atomic variable with a supplied expected value and
stores the supplied desired value if they’re equal. If the values aren’t equal, the
expected value is updated with the value of the atomic variable. The return type of
the compare-exchange functions is a bool, which is true if the store was performed
and false otherwise. The operation is said to succeed if the store was done (because
the values were equal), and fail otherwise; the return value is true for success, and
false for failure.
For compare_exchange_weak(), the store might not be successful even if the original value was equal to the expected value, in which case the value of the variable is
unchanged and the return value of compare_exchange_weak() is false. This is most
likely to happen on machines that lack a single compare-and-exchange instruction, if
the processor can’t guarantee that the operation has been done atomically—possibly
because the thread performing the operation was switched out in the middle of the
necessary sequence of instructions and another thread scheduled in its place by the
operating system where there are more threads than processors. This is called a spurious failure, because the reason for the failure is a function of timing rather than the
values of the variables.
Because compare_exchange_weak() can fail spuriously, it must typically be used in
a loop:
```cpp
bool expected=false;
extern atomic<bool> b; // set somewhere else
while(!b.compare_exchange_weak(expected,true) && !expected);
```

In this case, you keep looping as long as expected is still false, indicating that the
compare_exchange_weak() call failed spuriously.
On the other hand, compare_exchange_strong() is guaranteed to return false
only if the value wasn’t equal to the expected value. This can eliminate the need for
loops like the one shown where you want to know whether you successfully changed a
variable or whether another thread got there first.
If you want to change the variable whatever the initial value is (perhaps with an
updated value that depends on the current value), the update of expected becomes

136 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
useful; each time through the loop, expected is reloaded, so if no other thread modifies the value in the meantime, the compare_exchange_weak() or compare_exchange
_strong() call should be successful the next time around the loop. If the calculation
of the value to be stored is simple, it may be beneficial to use compare_exchange
_weak() in order to avoid a double loop on platforms where compare_exchange_weak()
can fail spuriously (and so compare_exchange_strong() contains a loop). On the
other hand, if the calculation of the value to be stored is time-consuming, it may make
sense to use compare_exchange_strong() to avoid having to recalculate the value to
store when the expected value hasn’t changed. For std::atomic<bool> this isn’t so
important—there are only two possible values after all—but for the larger atomic types
this can make a difference.
The compare-exchange functions are also unusual in that they can take two memoryordering parameters. This allows for the memory-ordering semantics to differ in the
case of success and failure; it might be desirable for a successful call to have memory
_order_acq_rel semantics, whereas a failed call has memory_order_relaxed semantics. A failed compare-exchange doesn’t do a store, so it can’t have memory_order
_release or memory_order_acq_rel semantics. It’s therefore not permitted to supply
these values as the ordering for failure. You also can’t supply stricter memory ordering
for failure than for success; if you want memory_order_acquire or memory_order_
seq_cst semantics for failure, you must specify those for success as well.
If you don’t specify an ordering for failure, it’s assumed to be the same as that for
success, except that the release part of the ordering is stripped: memory_order_release
becomes memory_order_relaxed, and memory_order_acq_rel becomes memory_order
_acquire. If you specify neither, they default to memory_order_seq_cst as usual,
which provides the full sequential ordering for both success and failure. The following
two calls to compare_exchange_weak() are equivalent:
```cpp
std::atomic<bool> b;
bool expected;
b.compare_exchange_weak(expected,true,
memory_order_acq_rel,memory_order_acquire);
b.compare_exchange_weak(expected,true,memory_order_acq_rel);
```

I’ll leave the consequences of the choice of memory ordering to section 5.3.
```cpp
One further difference between std::atomic<bool> and std::atomic_flag is
```

that std::atomic<bool> may not be lock-free; the implementation may have to
acquire a mutex internally in order to ensure the atomicity of the operations. For the
rare case when this matters, you can use the is_lock_free() member function to
check whether operations on std::atomic<bool> are lock-free. This is another feature common to all atomic types other than std::atomic_flag.
The next simplest of the atomic types are the atomic pointer specializations
std::atomic<T*>, so we’ll look at those next.

Atomic operations and types in C++ 137
### 5.2.4 Operations on std::atomic<T*>: pointer arithmetic

The atomic form of a pointer to some type T is std::atomic<T*>, just as the atomic
form of bool is std::atomic<bool>. The interface is the same, although it operates
on values of the corresponding pointer type rather than bool values. Like
```cpp
std::atomic<bool>, it’s neither copy-constructible nor copy-assignable, although it
```

can be both constructed and assigned from the suitable pointer values. As well as the
```cpp
obligatory is_lock_free() member function, std::atomic<T*> also has load(),
store(), exchange(), compare_exchange_weak(), and compare_exchange_strong()
```

member functions, with similar semantics to those of std::atomic<bool>, again taking and returning T* rather than bool.
The new operations provided by std::atomic<T*> are the pointer arithmetic
operations. The basic operations are provided by the fetch_add() and fetch_sub()
member functions, which do atomic addition and subtraction on the stored address,
and the += and -= operators, and both pre- and post-increment and decrement with
++ and --, which provide convenient wrappers. The operators work as you’d expect
from the built-in types: if x is std::atomic<Foo*> to the first entry of an array of Foo
objects, then x+=3 changes it to point to the fourth entry and returns a plain Foo* that
also points to that fourth entry. fetch_add() and fetch_sub() are slightly different in
that they return the original value (so x.fetch_add(3) will update x to point to the
fourth value but return a pointer to the first value in the array). This operation is also
known as exchange-and-add, and it’s an atomic read-modify-write operation, like
exchange() and compare_exchange_weak()/compare_exchange_strong(). As with
the other operations, the return value is a plain T* value rather than a reference to the
std::atomic<T*> object, so that the calling code can perform actions based on what
the previous value was:
```cpp
class Foo{};
```

Foo some_array[5];
Add 2 to p and
```cpp
std::atomic<Foo*> p(some_array);
return old value
Foo* x=p.fetch_add(2);
assert(x==some_array);
assert(p.load()==&some_array[2]);
x=(p-=1);
Subtract 1 from p and
assert(x==&some_array[1]);
return new value
assert(p.load()==&some_array[1]);
```

The function forms also allow the memory-ordering semantics to be specified as an
additional function call argument:
```cpp
p.fetch_add(3,std::memory_order_release);
```

Because both fetch_add() and fetch_sub() are read-modify-write operations, they
can have any of the memory-ordering tags and can participate in a release sequence. Specifying the ordering semantics isn’t possible for the operator forms, because there’s no

138 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
way of providing the information: these forms therefore always have memory_order_
seq_cst semantics.
The remaining basic atomic types are all the same: they’re all atomic integral types
and have the same interface as each other, except that the associated built-in type is
different. We’ll look at them as a group.
### 5.2.5 Operations on standard atomic integral types

As well as the usual set of operations (load(), store(), exchange(), compare_
exchange_weak(), and compare_exchange_strong()), the atomic integral types such
as std::atomic<int> or std::atomic<unsigned long long> have quite a comprehensive set of operations available: fetch_add(), fetch_sub(), fetch_and(), fetch_or(),
fetch_xor(), compound-assignment forms of these operations (+=, -=, &=, |=, and
^=), and pre- and post-increment and decrement (++x, x++, --x, and x--). It’s not quite
the full set of compound-assignment operations you could do on a normal integral
type, but it’s close enough: only division, multiplication, and shift operators are missing. Because atomic integral values are typically used either as counters or as bitmasks,
this isn’t a particularly noticeable loss; additional operations can easily be done using
compare_exchange_weak() in a loop, if required.
The semantics closely match those of fetch_add() and fetch_sub() for
std::atomic<T*>; the named functions atomically perform their operation and
return the old value, whereas the compound-assignment operators return the new
value. Pre- and post- increment and decrement work as usual: ++x increments the variable and returns the new value, whereas x++ increments the variable and returns the
old value. As you’ll be expecting, the result is a value of the associated integral type in
both cases.
We’ve now looked at all the basic atomic types; all that remains is the generic
std::atomic<> primary class template rather than the specializations, so let’s look at
that next.
### 5.2.6 The std::atomic<> primary class template

The presence of the primary template allows a user to create an atomic variant of a
user-defined type, in addition to the standard atomic types. Given a user-defined type
UDT, std::atomic<UDT> provides the same interface as std::atomic<bool> (as
described in section 5.2.3), except that the bool parameters and return types that
relate to the stored value (rather than the success/failure result of the compareexchange operations) are UDT instead. You can’t use just any user-defined type with
std::atomic<>, though; the type has to fulfill certain criteria. In order to use
std::atomic<UDT> for some user-defined type UDT,, this type must have a trivial copyassignment operator. This means that the type must not have any virtual functions or
virtual base classes and must use the compiler-generated copy-assignment operator.
Not only that, but every base class and non-static data member of a user-defined type
must also have a trivial copy-assignment operator. This permits the compiler to use

Atomic operations and types in C++ 139
memcpy() or an equivalent operation for assignment operations, because there’s no
user-written code to run.
Finally, it is worth noting that the compare-exchange operations do bitwise comparison as if using memcmp, rather than using any comparison operator that may be
defined for UDT. If the type provides comparison operations that have different semantics, or the type has padding bits that do not participate in normal comparisons, then
this can lead to a compare-exchange operation failing, even though the values compare equally.
The reasoning behind these restrictions goes back to one of the guidelines from
the lock by passing them as arguments to user-supplied functions. In general, the
compiler isn’t going to be able to generate lock-free code for std::atomic<UDT>, so it
will have to use an internal lock for all the operations. If user-supplied copy-assignment
or comparison operators were permitted, this would require passing a reference to
the protected data as an argument to a user-supplied function, violating the guideline.
Also, the library is entirely at liberty to use a single lock for all atomic operations that
need it, and allowing user-supplied functions to be called while holding that lock
might cause deadlock or cause other threads to block because a comparison operation took a long time. Finally, these restrictions increase the chance that the compiler
will be able to make use of atomic instructions directly for std::atomic<UDT> (and
make a particular instantiation lock-free), because it can treat the user-defined type as
a set of raw bytes.
Note that although you can use std::atomic<float> or std::atomic<double>,
because the built-in floating point types do satisfy the criteria for use with memcpy and
memcmp, the behavior may be surprising in the case of compare_exchange_strong
(compare_exchange_weak can always fail for arbitrary internal reasons, as described
previously). The operation may fail even though the old stored value was equal in
value to the comparand, if the stored value had a different representation. Note that
there are no atomic arithmetic operations on floating-point values. You’ll get similar
behavior with compare_exchange_strong if you use std::atomic<> with a userdefined type that has an equality-comparison operator defined, and that operator
differs from the comparison using memcmp—the operation may fail because the
otherwise-equal values have a different representation.
If your UDT is the same size as (or smaller than) an int or a void*, most common
platforms will be able to use atomic instructions for std::atomic<UDT>. Some platforms will also be able to use atomic instructions for user-defined types that are twice
the size of an int or void*. These platforms are typically those that support a so-called
double-word-compare-and-swap (DWCAS) instruction corresponding to the compare_
exchange_xxx functions. As you’ll see in chapter 7, such support can be helpful when
writing lock-free code.
These restrictions mean that you can’t, for example, create std::atomic<std::
vector<int>> (because it has a non-trivial copy constructor and copy assignment

140 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
operator), but you can instantiate std::atomic<> with classes containing counters or
flags or pointers or even arrays of simple data elements. This isn’t particularly a problem; the more complex the data structure, the more likely you’ll want to do operations on it other than simple assignment and comparison. If that’s the case, you’re
better off using an std::mutex to ensure that the data is appropriately protected for
the desired operations, as described in chapter 3.
 As already mentioned, when instantiated with a user-defined type T, the interface
of std::atomic<T> is limited to the set of operations available for std::atomic<bool>:
load(), store(), exchange(), compare_exchange_weak(), compare_exchange_strong(),
and assignment from and conversion to an instance of type T.
 Table 5.3 shows the operations available on each atomic type.

### 5.2.7 Free functions for atomic operations

Up until now I’ve limited myself to describing the member function forms of the
operations on the atomic types. But there are also equivalent nonmember functions
for all the operations on the various atomic types. For the most part, the nonmember
functions are named after the corresponding member functions but with an atomic_
prefix (for example, std::atomic_load()). These functions are then overloaded for

Atomic operations and types in C++ 141
each of the atomic types. Where there’s opportunity for specifying a memory-ordering
tag, they come in two varieties: one without the tag and one with an _explicit suffix
and an additional parameter or parameters for the memory-ordering tag or tags (for
```cpp
example, std::atomic_store(&atomic_var,new_value) versus std::atomic_store_
explicit(&atomic_var,new_value,std::memory_order_release). Whereas the atomic
```

object being referenced by the member functions is implicit, all the free functions
take a pointer to the atomic object as the first parameter.
For example, std::atomic_is_lock_free() comes in one variety (though overloaded for each type), and std::atomic_is_lock_free(&a) returns the same value as
a.is_lock_free() for an object of atomic type a. Likewise, std::atomic_load(&a) is
the same as a.load(), but the equivalent of a.load(std::memory_order_acquire) is
```cpp
std::atomic_load_explicit(&a, std::memory_order_acquire).
```

The free functions are designed to be C-compatible, so they use pointers rather
than references in all cases. For example, the first parameter of the compare_ex-
change_weak() and compare_exchange_strong() member functions (the expected
value) is a reference, whereas the second parameter of std::atomic_compare_
exchange_weak() (the first is the object pointer) is a pointer. std::atomic_compare
_exchange_weak_explicit() also requires both the success and failure memory
orders to be specified, whereas the compare-exchange member functions have both a
single memory order form (with a default of std::memory_order_seq_cst) and an
overload that takes the success and failure memory orders separately.
The operations on std::atomic_flag buck the trend in that they spell out the
```cpp
flag part in the names: std::atomic_flag_test_and_set(), std::atomic_flag_
```

clear(). The additional variants that specify the memory ordering again have the
```cpp
_explicit suffix: std::atomic_flag_test_and_set_explicit() and std::atomic_
```

flag_clear_explicit().
The C++ Standard Library also provides free functions for accessing instances of
std::shared_ptr<> in an atomic fashion. This is a break from the principle that only
the atomic types support atomic operations, because std::shared_ptr<> is quite definitely not an atomic type (accessing the same std::shared_ptr<T> object from multiple threads without using the atomic access functions from all threads, or using
suitable other external synchronization, is a data race and undefined behavior). But
the C++ Standards Committee felt it was sufficiently important to provide these extra
functions. The atomic operations available are load, store, exchange, and compareexchange, which are provided as overloads of the same operations on the standard
atomic types, taking an std::shared_ptr<>* as the first argument:
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<my_data> p;
void process_global_data()
{
std::shared_ptr<my_data> local=std::atomic_load(&p);
process_data(local);
}
```

142 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
```cpp
void update_global_data()
{
std::shared_ptr<my_data> local(new my_data);
std::atomic_store(&p,local);
}
```

As with the atomic operations on other types, the _explicit variants are also provided to allow you to specify the desired memory ordering, and the std::atomic_
is_lock_free() function can be used to check whether the implementation uses
locks to ensure the atomicity.
```cpp
The Concurrency TS also provides std::experimental::atomic_shared_ptr<T>,
```

which is an atomic type. To use it you must include the <experimental/atomic>
header. It provides the same set of operations as std::atomic<UDT>: load, store,
exchange, compare-exchange. It is provided as a separate type because that allows for
a lock-free implementation that does not impose an additional cost on plain
std::shared_ptr instances. But as with the std::atomic template, you still need to
check whether it is lock-free on your platform, which can be tested with the is_lock_
free member function. Even if it is not lock-free, std::experimental::atomic_
shared_ptr is to be recommended over using the atomic free functions on a plain
std::shared_ptr, as it is clearer in your code, ensures that all accesses are atomic,
and avoids the potential for data races due to forgetting to use the atomic free functions. As with all uses of atomic types and operations, if you are using them for a
potential speed gain, it is important to profile, and compare with using alternative synchronization mechanisms.
As described in the introduction, the standard atomic types do more than avoid
the undefined behavior associated with a data race; they allow the user to enforce an
ordering of operations between threads. This enforced ordering is the basis of the
facilities for protecting data and synchronizing operations such as std::mutex and
std::future<>. With that in mind, let’s move on to the real meat of this chapter: the
details of the concurrency aspects of the memory model and how atomic operations
can be used to synchronize data and enforce ordering.
## 5.3 Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering

Suppose you have two threads, one of which is populating a data structure to be read
by the second. In order to avoid a problematic race condition, the first thread sets a
flag to indicate that the data is ready, and the second thread doesn’t read the data
until the flag is set. The following listing shows such a scenario.
Listing5.2 Reading and writing variables from different threads
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <atomic>
#include <iostream>
std::vector<int> data;
std::atomic<bool> data_ready(false);

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 143
void reader_thread()
{
```

b
```cpp
while(!data_ready.load())
{
std::this_thread::sleep(std::chrono::milliseconds(1));
}
std::cout<<”The answer=”<<data[0]<<”\n”;
}
void writer_thread()
{
data.push_back(42);
```

e
```cpp
data_ready=true;
}
```

B
Setting aside the inefficiency of the loop waiting for the data to be ready , you
need this to work, because otherwise sharing data between threads becomes impractical: every item of data is forced to be atomic. You’ve already learned that it’s undec d
fined behavior to have non-atomic reads and writes accessing the same data
without an enforced ordering, so for this to work there must be an enforced ordering
somewhere.
The required enforced ordering comes from the operations on the std::
atomic<bool> variable, data_ready;, they provide the necessary ordering by virtue of
the memory model relations happens-before and synchronizes-with. The write of the data
d e B
happens before the write to the data_ready flag , and the read of the flag
c B
happens before the read of the data . When the value read from data_ready is
true, the write synchronizes with that read, creating a happens-before relationship.
Because happens-before is transitive, the write to the data happens before the write
e B
to the flag , which happens before the read of the true value from the flag ,
which happens before the read of the data , and you have an enforced ordering: the
write of the data happens before the read of the data and everything is OK. Figure 5.2 shows the important happens-before relationships in the two threads. I’ve added a
couple of iterations of the while loop from the reader thread.
All this might seem fairly intuitive: the operation that writes a value happens before
an operation that reads that value. With the default atomic operations, that’s indeed
true (which is why this is the default), but it does need spelling out: the atomic operations also have other options for the ordering requirements, which I’ll come to shortly.
Now that you’ve seen happens-before and synchronizes-with in action, it’s time to
look at what they mean. I’ll start with synchronizes-with.
### 5.3.1 The synchronizes-with relationship

The synchronizes-with relationship is something that you can get only between operations on atomic types. Operations on a data structure (such as locking a mutex) might
provide this relationship if the data structure contains atomic types and the operations on that data structure perform the appropriate atomic operations internally, but
fundamentally it comes only from operations on atomic types.

(returns 42)
Writer thread Reader thread
Figure 5.2 Enforcing an ordering between non-atomic operations using atomic operations
The basic idea is this: a suitably-tagged atomic write operation, W, on a variable, x, synchronizes with a suitably-tagged atomic read operation on x that reads the value stored
by either that write, W, or a subsequent atomic write operation on x by the same thread
that performed the initial write, W, or a sequence of atomic read-modify-write operations
on x (such as fetch_add() or compare_exchange_weak()) by any thread, where the
value read by the first thread in the sequence is the value written by W (see section 5.3.4).
Leave the “suitably-tagged” part aside for now, because all operations on atomic
types are suitably tagged by default. This means what you might expect: if thread A
stores a value and thread B reads that value, there’s a synchronizes-with relationship
between the store in thread A and the load in thread B, as in listing 5.2. This is illustrated in figure 5.2.
As I’m sure you’ve guessed, the nuances are all in the “suitably-tagged” part. The
C++ memory model allows various ordering constraints to be applied to the operations on atomic types, and this is the tagging to which I refer. The various options for
memory ordering and how they relate to the synchronizes-with relationship are covered in section 5.3.3. First, let’s step back and look at the happens-before relationship.

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 145
### 5.3.2 The happens-before relationship

The happens-before and strongly-happens-before relationships are the basic building blocks
of operation ordering in a program; it specifies which operations see the effects of
which other operations. For a single thread, it’s largely straightforward: if one operation is sequenced before another, then it also happens before it, and strongly-happensbefore it. This means that if one operation (A) occurs in a statement prior to another
(B) in the source code, then A happens before B, and A strongly-happens-before B.
You saw that in listing 5.2: the write to data happens before the write to
e
data_ready . If the operations occur in the same statement, in general there’s no
happens-before relationship between them, because they’re unordered. This is
another way of saying that the ordering is unspecified. You know that the program in
the following listing will output “1,2” or “2,1”, but it’s unspecified which, because
the order of the two calls to get_num()is unspecified.
Listing5.3 Order of evaluation of arguments to a function call is unspecified
```cpp
#include <iostream>
void foo(int a,int b)
{
std::cout<<a<<”,”<<b<<std::endl;
}
int get_num()
{
static int i=0;
return ++i;
}
int main()
Calls to get_num()
{
are unordered.
foo(get_num(),get_num());
}
```

There are circumstances where operations within a single statement are sequenced,
such as where the built-in comma operator is used or where the result of one expression is used as an argument to another expression. But in general, operations within a
single statement are nonsequenced, and there’s no sequenced-before (and thus no
happens-before) relationship between them. All operations in a statement happen
before all of the operations in the next statement.
This is a restatement of the single-threaded sequencing rules you’re used to, so
what’s new? The new part is the interaction between threads: if operation A on one
thread inter-thread happens before operation B on another thread, then A happens
before B. This doesn’t help much: you’ve added a new relationship (inter-thread
happens-before), but this is an important relationship when you’re writing multithreaded code.
At the basic level, inter-thread happens-before is relatively simple and relies on the
synchronizes-with relationship introduced in section 5.3.1: if operation A in one
thread synchronizes with operation B in another thread, then A inter-thread happens

146 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
before B. It’s also a transitive relation: if A inter-thread happens before B and B interthread happens before C, then A inter-thread happens before C. You saw this in listing 5.2 as well.
Inter-thread happens-before also combines with the sequenced-before relation: if
operation A is sequenced before operation B, and operation B inter-thread happens
before operation C, then A inter-thread happens before C. Similarly, if A synchronizes
with B and B is sequenced before C, then A inter-thread happens before C. These two
together mean that if you make a series of changes to data in a single thread, you need
only one synchronizes-with relationship for the data to be visible to subsequent operations on the thread that executed C.
The strongly-happens-before relationship is slightly different, but in most cases
comes down the same. The same two rules described above apply: if operation A
synchronizes-with operation B, or operation A is sequenced-before operation B, then
A strongly-happens-before B. Transitive ordering also applies: if A strongly-happensbefore B, and B strongly-happens-before C, then A strongly-happens-before C. The
difference is that operations tagged with memory_order_consume (see section 5.3.3)
participate in inter-thread-happens-before relationships (and thus happens-before
relationships), but not in strongly-happens-before relationships. Since the vast majority of code should not be using memory_order_consume, this distinction is unlikely to
affect you in practice. I will use “happens-before” in the rest of this book for brevity.
These are the crucial rules that enforce the ordering of operations between
threads and make everything in listing 5.2 work. There are some additional nuances
with data dependency, as you’ll see shortly. In order for you to understand this, I need
to cover the memory-ordering tags used for atomic operations and how they relate to
the synchronizes-with relation.
### 5.3.3 Memory ordering for atomic operations

There are six memory ordering options that can be applied to operations on atomic
types: memory_order_relaxed, memory_order_consume, memory_order_acquire, memory
_order_release, memory_order_acq_rel, and memory_order_seq_cst. Unless you
specify otherwise for a particular operation, the memory-ordering option for all operations on atomic types is memory_order_seq_cst, which is the most stringent of the
available options. Although there are six ordering options, they represent three models: sequentially consistent ordering (memory_order_seq_cst), acquire-release ordering
(memory_order_consume, memory_order_acquire, memory_order_release, and memo-
ry_order_acq_rel), and relaxed ordering (memory_order_relaxed).
These distinct memory-ordering models can have varying costs on different CPU
architectures. For example, on systems based on architectures with fine control over
the visibility of operations by processors other than the one that made the change,
additional synchronization instructions can be required for sequentially consistent
ordering over acquire-release ordering or relaxed ordering and for acquire-release
ordering over relaxed ordering. If these systems have many processors, these additional

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 147
synchronization instructions may take a significant amount of time, reducing the overall
performance of the system. On the other hand, CPUs that use the x86 or x8664 architectures (such as the Intel and AMD processors common in desktop PCs) don’t require
any additional instructions for acquire-release ordering beyond those necessary for
ensuring atomicity, and even sequentially-consistent ordering doesn’t require any special treatment for load operations, although there’s a small additional cost on stores.
The availability of the distinct memory-ordering models allows experts to take
advantage of the increased performance of the more fine-grained ordering relationships where they’re advantageous while allowing the use of the default sequentiallyconsistent ordering (which is considerably easier to reason about than the others) for
those cases that are less critical.
In order to choose which ordering model to use, or to understand the ordering
relationships in code that uses the different models, it’s important to know how the
choices affect the program behavior. Let’s therefore look at the consequences of each
choice for operation ordering and synchronizes-with.
SEQUENTIALLY CONSISTENT ORDERING
The default ordering is named sequentially consistent because it implies that the behavior of the program is consistent with a simple sequential view of the world. If all operations on instances of atomic types are sequentially consistent, the behavior of a
multithreaded program is as if all these operations were performed in some particular
sequence by a single thread. This is by far the easiest memory ordering to understand,
which is why it’s the default: all threads must see the same order of operations. This
makes it easy to reason about the behavior of code written with atomic variables. You
can write down all the possible sequences of operations by different threads, eliminate
those that are inconsistent, and verify that your code behaves as expected in the others. It also means that operations can’t be reordered; if your code has one operation
before another in one thread, that ordering must be seen by all other threads.
From the point of view of synchronization, a sequentially consistent store synchronizes with a sequentially consistent load of the same variable that reads the value
stored. This provides one ordering constraint on the operation of two (or more)
threads, but sequential consistency is more powerful than that. Any sequentially consistent atomic operations done after that load must also appear after the store to other
threads in the system using sequentially consistent atomic operations. The example in
listing 5.4 demonstrates this ordering constraint in action. This constraint doesn’t
carry forward to threads that use atomic operations with relaxed memory orderings;
they can still see the operations in a different order, so you must use sequentially consistent operations on all your threads in order to get the benefit.
This ease of understanding can come at a price, though. On a weakly-ordered
machine with many processors, it can impose a noticeable performance penalty,
because the overall sequence of operations must be kept consistent between the processors, possibly requiring extensive (and expensive!) synchronization operations between
the processors. That said, some processor architectures (such as the common x86 and

148 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
x86-64 architectures) offer sequential consistency relatively cheaply, so if you’re concerned about the performance implications of using sequentially consistent ordering,
check the documentation for your target processor architectures.
The following listing shows sequential consistency in action. The loads and stores
to x and y are explicitly tagged with memory_order_seq_cst, although this tag could
be omitted in this case because it’s the default.
Listing5.4 Sequential consistency implies a total ordering
```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <assert.h>
std::atomic<bool> x,y;
std::atomic<int> z;
void write_x()
{
```

b
```cpp
x.store(true,std::memory_order_seq_cst);
}
void write_y()
{
y.store(true,std::memory_order_seq_cst);
}
void read_x_then_y()
{
while(!x.load(std::memory_order_seq_cst));
if(y.load(std::memory_order_seq_cst))
```

++z;
```cpp
}
void read_y_then_x()
{
while(!y.load(std::memory_order_seq_cst));
```

e
```cpp
if(x.load(std::memory_order_seq_cst))
```

++z;
```cpp
}
int main()
{
x=false;
y=false;
z=0;
std::thread a(write_x);
std::thread b(write_y);
std::thread c(read_x_then_y);
std::thread d(read_y_then_x);
a.join();
b.join();
c.join();
d.join();
- assert(z.load()!=0);
}
```

- B c
The assert can never fire, because either the store to x or the store to y must
happen first, even though it’s not specified which. If the load of y in read_x_then_y

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 149
returns false, the store to x must occur before the store to y, in which case the load of
e
x in read_y_then_x must return true, because the while loop ensures that the y is
true at this point. Because the semantics of memory_order_seq_cst require a single
total ordering over all operations tagged memory_order_seq_cst, there’s an implied
d B
ordering relationship between a load of y that returns false and the store to y .
For there to be a single total order, if one thread sees x==true and then subsequently sees y==false, this implies that the store to x occurs before the store to y in
this total order.
Because everything is symmetrical, it could also happen the other way around, with
e d
the load of x returning false, forcing the load of y to return true. In both
cases, z is equal to 1. Both loads can return true, leading to z being 2, but under no
circumstances can z be 0.
The operations and happens-before relationships for the case that read_x_then_y
sees x as true and y as false are shown in figure 5.3. The dashed line from the load of
y in read_x_then_y to the store to y in write_y shows the implied ordering relationship required in order to maintain sequential consistency: the load must occur before
the store in the global order of memory_order_seq_cst operations in order to achieve
the outcomes given here.
Initiallyx=false,y=false
x.store(true) y.store(true)
x.load() y.load()
returnstrue returnstrue
y.load() x.load()
returnsfalse returnstrue
write_x read_x_then_y read_y_then_x write_y
Figure 5.3 Sequential consistency and happens-before
Sequential consistency is the most straightforward and intuitive ordering, but it’s also
the most expensive memory ordering because it requires global synchronization
between all threads. On a multiprocessor system this may require extensive and timeconsuming communication between processors.
In order to avoid this synchronization cost, you need to step outside the world of
sequential consistency and consider using other memory orderings.
NON-SEQUENTIALLY CONSISTENT MEMORY ORDERINGS
Once you step outside the nice sequentially-consistent world, things start to get complicated. The single biggest issue to get to grips with is probably the fact that there’s no

150 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
longer a single global order of events. This means that different threads can see different
views of the same operations, and any mental model you have of operations from different threads neatly interleaved one after the other must be thrown away. Not only
do you have to account for things happening truly concurrently, but threads don’t have
to agree on the order of events. In order to write (or even to understand) any code that
uses a memory ordering other than the default memory_order_seq_cst, it’s absolutely
vital to get your head around this. It’s not just that the compiler can reorder the
instructions. Even if the threads are running the same bit of code, they can disagree
on the order of events because of operations in other threads in the absence of
explicit ordering constraints, because the different CPU caches and internal buffers
can hold different values for the same memory. It’s so important I’ll say it again:
threads don’t have to agree on the order of events.
Not only do you have to throw out mental models based on interleaving operations, you also have to throw out mental models based on the idea of the compiler or
processor reordering the instructions. In the absence of other ordering constraints, the only
requirement is that all threads agree on the modification order of each individual variable. Operations on distinct variables can appear in different orders on different threads, provided the values seen are consistent with any additional ordering constraints imposed.
This is best demonstrated by stepping completely outside the sequentially consistent world and using memory_order_relaxed for all operations. Once you’ve come to
grips with that, you can move back to acquire-release ordering, which allows you to
selectively introduce ordering relationships between operations and claw back some
of your sanity.
RELAXED ORDERING
Operations on atomic types performed with relaxed ordering don’t participate in
synchronizes-with relationships. Operations on the same variable within a single thread
still obey happens-before relationships, but there’s almost no requirement on ordering relative to other threads. The only requirement is that accesses to a single atomic
variable from the same thread can’t be reordered; once a given thread has seen a particular value of an atomic variable, a subsequent read by that thread can’t retrieve
an earlier value of the variable. Without any additional synchronization, the modification order of each variable is the only thing shared between threads that are using
memory_order_relaxed.
To demonstrate how relaxed your relaxed operations can be, you need only two
threads, as shown in the following listing.
Listing5.5 Relaxed operations have few ordering requirements
```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <assert.h>
std::atomic<bool> x,y;
std::atomic<int> z;
void write_x_then_y()

```cpp
x.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);
y.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);
} c
void read_y_then_x()
{
while(!y.load(std::memory_order_relaxed));
if(x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed))
```

++z; e
```cpp
}
int main()
{
x=false;
y=false;
z=0;
std::thread a(write_x_then_y);
std::thread b(read_y_then_x);
a.join();
b.join();
- assert(z.load()!=0);
}
```

- e
This time the assert can fire, because the load of x can read false, even though
d B c
the load of y reads true and the store of x happens before the store of y . x
and y are different variables, so there are no ordering guarantees relating to the visibility of values arising from operations on each.
Relaxed operations on different variables can be freely reordered provided they
obey any happens-before relationships they’re bound by (for example, within the
same thread). They don’t introduce synchronizes-with relationships. The happensbefore relationships from listing 5.5 are shown in figure 5.4, along with a possible outcome. Even though there’s a happens-before relationship between the stores and

between the loads, there isn’t one between either store and either load, and so the
loads can see the stores out of order.
Let’s look at the slightly more complex example with three variables and five
threads in the next listing.

B
This is a simple program. You have three shared global atomic variables and five
threads. Each thread loops 10 times, reading the values of the three atomic variables
using memory_order_relaxed and storing them in an array. Three of the threads each
e
update one of the atomic variables each time through the loop , whereas the other
two threads read. Once all the threads have been joined, you print the values from the
h
arrays stored by each thread .
The go atomic variable is used to ensure that the threads all start the loop as
near to the same time as possible. Launching a thread is an expensive operation, and
without the explicit delay, the first thread may be finished before the last one has
started. Each thread waits for go to become true before entering the main loop
- g
and , and go is set to true only once all the threads have started .
One possible output from this program is as follows:
(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(2,0,0),(3,0,0),(4,0,0),(5,7,0),(6,7,8),(7,9,8),(8,9,8),
(9,9,10)
(0,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,2,0),(1,3,5),(8,4,5),(8,5,5),(8,6,6),(8,7,9),(10,8,9),
(10,9,10)
(0,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,0,2),(0,0,3),(0,0,4),(0,0,5),(0,0,6),(0,0,7),(0,0,8),
(0,0,9)
(1,3,0),(2,3,0),(2,4,1),(3,6,4),(3,9,5),(5,10,6),(5,10,8),(5,10,10),
(9,10,10),(10,10,10)
(0,0,0),(0,0,0),(0,0,0),(6,3,7),(6,5,7),(7,7,7),(7,8,7),(8,8,7),(8,8,9),
(8,8,9)
The first three lines are the threads doing the updating, and the last two are the
threads doing the reading. Each triplet is a set of the variables x, y, and z, in that

154 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
order, from one pass through the loop. There are a few things to notice from
thisoutput:
- The first set of values shows x increasing by one with each triplet, the second set
has y increasing by one, and the third has z increasing by one.
- The x elements of each triplet only increase within a given set, as do the y and z
elements, but the increments are uneven, and the relative orderings vary
between all threads.
- Thread 3 doesn’t see any of the updates to x or y; it sees only the updates it
makes to z. This doesn’t stop the other threads from seeing the updates to z
mixed in with the updates to x and y, though.
This is a valid outcome for relaxed operations, but it’s not the only valid outcome. Any
set of values that’s consistent with the three variables, each holding the values 0 to 10
in turn, and that has the thread incrementing a given variable printing the values 0 to
9 for that variable, is valid.
UNDERSTANDING RELAXED ORDERING
To understand how this works, imagine that each variable is a man in a cubicle with a
notepad. On his notepad is a list of values. You can phone him and ask him to give you
a value, or you can tell him to write down a new value. If you tell him to write down a
new value, he writes it at the bottom of the list. If you ask him for a value, he reads you
a number from the list.
The first time you talk to this man, if you ask him for a value, he may give you any
value from the list he has on his pad at the time. If you then ask him for another value,
he may give you the same one again or a value from farther down the list. He’ll never
give you a value from farther up the list. If you tell him to write down a number and
then subsequently ask him for a value, he’ll give you either the number you told him
to write down or a number below that on the list.
Imagine for a moment that his list starts with the values 5, 10, 23, 3, 1, and 2. If you
ask for a value, you could get any of those. If he gives you 10, then the next time you ask
he could give you 10 again, or any of the later ones, but not 5. If you call him five
times, he could say “10, 10, 1, 2, 2,” for example. If you tell him to write down 42, he’ll
add it to the end of the list. If you ask him for a number again, he’ll keep telling you
“42” until he has another number on his list and he feels like telling it to you.
Now, imagine your friend Carl also has this man’s number. Carl can also phone
him and either ask him to write down a number or ask for one, and he applies the
same rules to Carl as he does to you. He has only one phone, so he can only deal with
one of you at a time, so the list on his pad is a nice straightforward list. But just
because you got him to write down a new number doesn’t mean he has to tell it to
Carl, and vice versa. If Carl asked him for a number and was told “23,” then just
because you asked the man to write down 42 doesn’t mean he’ll tell that to Carl next
time. He may tell Carl any of the numbers 23, 3, 1, 2, 42, or even the 67 that Fred told
him to write down after you called. He could very well tell Carl “23, 3, 3, 1, 67” without

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 155
being inconsistent with what he told you. It’s like he keeps track of which number he
told to whom with a little moveable sticky note for each person, like in figure 5.5.
Figure 5.5 The notebook for
the man in the cubicle
Now imagine that there’s not just one man in a cubicle but a whole cubicle farm, with
loads of men with phones and notepads. These are all our atomic variables. Each variable has its own modification order (the list of values on the pad), but there’s no relationship between them at all. If each caller (you, Carl, Anne, Dave, and Fred) is a
thread, then this is what you get when every operation uses memory_order_relaxed.
There are a few additional things you can tell the man in the cubicle, such as “Write
down this number, and tell me what was at the bottom of the list” (exchange) and
“Write down this number if the number on the bottom of the list is that; otherwise tell
me what I should have guessed” (compare_exchange_strong), but that doesn’t affect
the general principle.
If you think about the program logic from listing 5.5, then write_x_then_y is
like some guy calling up the man in cubicle x and telling him to write true, then
calling up the man in cubicle y and telling him to write true. The thread running
read_y_then_x repeatedly calls up the man in cubicle y asking for a value until he says
true and then calls the man in cubicle x to ask for a value. The man in cubicle x is
under no obligation to tell you any specific value off his list and is quite within his
rights to say false.
This makes relaxed atomic operations difficult to deal with. They must be used in
combination with atomic operations that feature stronger ordering semantics in order
to be useful for inter-thread synchronization. I strongly recommend avoiding relaxed
atomic operations unless they’re absolutely necessary, and even then using them only
with extreme caution. Given the unintuitive results that can be achieved with only two
threads and two variables in listing 5.5, it’s not hard to imagine the possible complexity when more threads and more variables are involved.
One way to achieve additional synchronization without the overhead of full-blown
sequential consistency is to use acquire-release ordering.
ACQUIRE-RELEASE ORDERING
Acquire-release ordering is a step up from relaxed ordering; there’s still no total order
of operations, but it does introduce some synchronization. Under this ordering model,
atomic loads are acquire operations (memory_order_acquire), atomic stores are release
operations (memory_order_release), and atomic read-modify-write operations (such

156 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
as fetch_add() or exchange()) are either acquire, release, or both (memory_order_
acq_rel). Synchronization is pairwise between the thread that does the release and
the thread that does the acquire. A release operation synchronizes-with an acquire operation
that reads the value written. This means that different threads can still see different
orderings, but these orderings are restricted. The following listing is a reworking of
listing 5.4 using acquire-release semantics rather than sequentially-consistent ones.
Listing5.7 Acquire-release doesn’t imply a total ordering
```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <assert.h>
std::atomic<bool> x,y;
std::atomic<int> z;
void write_x()
{
x.store(true,std::memory_order_release);
}
void write_y()
{
y.store(true,std::memory_order_release);
}
void read_x_then_y()
{
while(!x.load(std::memory_order_acquire));
```

b
```cpp
if(y.load(std::memory_order_acquire))
```

++z;
```cpp
}
void read_y_then_x()
{
while(!y.load(std::memory_order_acquire));
if(x.load(std::memory_order_acquire))
```

++z;
```cpp
}
int main()
{
x=false;
y=false;
z=0;
std::thread a(write_x);
std::thread b(write_y);
std::thread c(read_x_then_y);
std::thread d(read_y_then_x);
a.join();
b.join();
c.join();
d.join();
assert(z.load()!=0);
}
```

In this case the assert can fire (like in the relaxed-ordering case), because it’s possic B
ble for both the load of x and the load of y to read false. x and y are written by

| Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering |     |     | 157 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
different threads, so the ordering from the release to the acquire in each case has no
effect on the operations in the other threads.
 Figure 5.6 shows the happens-before relationships from listing 5.7, along with a
possible outcome where the two reading threads each have a different view of the
world. This is possible because there’s no happens-before relationship to force an
ordering, as described previously.

Figure 5.6 Acquire-release and happens-before
In order to see the benefit of acquire-release ordering, you need to consider two
stores from the same thread, like in listing 5.5. If you change the store to y to use mem-
ory_order_release and the load from y to use memory_order_acquire like in the following listing, then you impose an ordering on the operations on x.
Listing5.8 Acquire-release operations can impose ordering on relaxed operations
```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <assert.h>
std::atomic<bool> x,y;
std::atomic<int> z;
void write_x_then_y()
```

B
```cpp
{
    x.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);
    y.store(true,std::memory_order_release);
}
```

Spin, waiting for y
{ to be set to true
```cpp
    while(!y.load(std::memory_order_acquire));
```

```cpp
    if(x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed))
```

        ++z;
```cpp
}
```

158 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
```cpp
int main()
{
x=false;
y=false;
z=0;
std::thread a(write_x_then_y);
std::thread b(read_y_then_x);
a.join();
b.join();
- assert(z.load()!=0);
}
d c
```

Eventually, the load from y, will see true as written by the store . Because the
store uses memory_order_release and the load uses memory_order_acquire, the store
B c
synchronizes with the load. The store to x happens before the store to y because
they’re in the same thread. Because the store to y synchronizes with the load from y,
the store to x also happens before the load from y and by extension happens before
e - the load from x . Thus, the load from x must read true, and the assert can’t fire.
If the load from y wasn’t in a while loop, this wouldn’t necessarily be the case; the
load from y might read false, in which case there’d be no requirement on the value
read from x. In order to provide any synchronization, acquire and release operations
must be paired up. The value stored by a release operation must be seen by an acquire
c d
operation for either to have any effect. If either the store at or the load at was a
relaxed operation, there’d be no ordering on the accesses to x, so there’d be no guare
antee that the load at would read true, and the assert could fire.
You can still think about acquire-release ordering in terms of our men with notepads in their cubicles, but you have to add more to the model. First, imagine that
every store that’s done is part of some batch of updates, so when you call a man to tell
him to write down a number, you also tell him which batch this update is part of:
“Please write down 99, as part of batch 423.” For the last store in a batch, you tell this
to the man too: “Please write down 147, which is the last store in batch 423.” The
man in the cubicle will then duly write down this information, along with who gave
him the value. This models a store-release operation. The next time you tell someone to write down a value, you increase the batch number: “Please write down 41, as
part of batch 424.”
When you ask for a value, you now have a choice: you can either ask for a value
(which is a relaxed load), in which case the man only gives you the number, or you
can ask for a value and information about whether it’s the last in a batch (which models a load-acquire). If you ask for the batch information, and the value wasn’t the last
in a batch, the man will tell you something like, “The number is 987, which is a ‘normal’
value,” whereas if it was the last in a batch, he’ll tell you something like “The number is
987, which is the last number in batch 956 from Anne.” Now, here’s where the acquirerelease semantics kick in: if you tell the man all the batches you know about when you
ask for a value, he’ll look down his list for the last value from any of the batches you
know about and either give you that number or one further down the list.

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 159
How does this model acquire-release semantics? Let’s look at our example and see.
First off, thread a is running write_x_then_y and says to the man in cubicle x,
“Please write true as part of batch 1 from thread a,” which he duly writes down.
Thread a then says to the man in cubicle y, “Please write true as the last write of
batch 1 from thread a,” which he duly writes down. In the meantime, thread b is
running read_y_then_x. Thread b keeps asking the man in box y for a value with
batch information until he says “true.” It may have to ask many times, but eventually
the man will say “true.” The man in box y doesn’t only say “true” though; he also says,
“This is the last write in batch 1 from thread a.”
Now, thread b goes on to ask the man in box x for a value, but this time it says,
“Please can I have a value, and by the way I know about batch 1 from thread a.” Now
the man from cubicle x has to look down his list for the last mention of batch 1 from
thread a. The only mention he has is the value true, which is also the last value on his
list, so he must read out that value; otherwise, he’s breaking the rules of the game.
If you look at the definition of inter-thread happens-before back in section 5.3.2,
one of the important properties is that it’s transitive: if A inter-thread happens before B
and B inter-thread happens before C, then A inter-thread happens before C. This means that
acquire-release ordering can be used to synchronize data across several threads, even
when the “intermediate” threads haven’t touched the data.
TRANSITIVE SYNCHRONIZATION WITH ACQUIRE-RELEASE ORDERING
In order to think about transitive ordering, you need at least three threads. The first
thread modifies some shared variables and does a store-release to one of them. A second thread then reads the variable subject to the store-release with a load-acquire and
performs a store-release on a second shared variable. Finally, a third thread does a
load-acquire on that second shared variable. Provided that the load-acquire operations see the values written by the store-release operations to ensure the synchronizeswith relationships, this third thread can read the values of the other variables stored
by the first thread, even if the intermediate thread didn’t touch any of them. This scenario is shown in the next listing.
Listing5.9 Transitive synchronization using acquire and release ordering
```cpp
std::atomic<int> data[5];
std::atomic<bool> sync1(false),sync2(false);
void thread_1()
{
data[0].store(42,std::memory_order_relaxed);
data[1].store(97,std::memory_order_relaxed);
data[2].store(17,std::memory_order_relaxed);
data[3].store(-141,std::memory_order_relaxed);
data[4].store(2003,std::memory_order_relaxed);
```

B
```cpp
sync1.store(true,std::memory_order_release); Set sync1
}
void thread_2()
Loop until
{
sync1 is set
while(!sync1.load(std::memory_order_acquire));
```

160 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
```cpp
sync2.store(true,std::memory_order_release); Set sync2
}
void thread_3() e
Loop until
{
sync2 is set
while(!sync2.load(std::memory_order_acquire));
assert(data[0].load(std::memory_order_relaxed)==42);
assert(data[1].load(std::memory_order_relaxed)==97);
assert(data[2].load(std::memory_order_relaxed)==17);
assert(data[3].load(std::memory_order_relaxed)==-141);
assert(data[4].load(std::memory_order_relaxed)==2003);
}
c d
```

Even though thread_2 only touches the variables sync1 and sync2 , this is
enough for synchronization between thread_1 and thread_3 to ensure that the asserts
don’t fire. First off, the stores to data from thread_1 happens before the store to sync1
B
because they’re sequenced before it in the same thread. Because the load from
B
sync1 is in a while loop, it will eventually see the value stored from thread_1 and
form the second half of the release-acquire pair. Therefore, the store to sync1 happens
before the final load from sync1 in the while loop. This load is sequenced before (and
thus happens before) the store to sync2 , which forms a release-acquire pair with the
e d
final load from the while loop in thread_3 . The store to sync2 thus happens
e
before the load , which happens before the loads from data. Because of the transitive
nature of happens-before, you can chain it all together: the stores to data happen
B c
before the store to sync1 , which happens before the load from sync1 , which hapd e
pens before the store to sync2 , which happens before the load from sync2 , which
happens before the loads from data. Thus the stores to data in thread_1 happen
before the loads from data in thread_3, and the asserts can’t fire.
In this case, you could combine sync1 and sync2 into a single variable by using a
read-modify-write operation with memory_order_acq_rel in thread_2. One option
would be to use compare_exchange_strong() to ensure that the value is updated only
once the store from thread_1 has been seen:
```cpp
std::atomic<int> sync(0);
void thread_1()
{
// ...
sync.store(1,std::memory_order_release);
}
void thread_2()
{
int expected=1;
while(!sync.compare_exchange_strong(expected,2,
std::memory_order_acq_rel))
expected=1;
}
void thread_3()
{
while(sync.load(std::memory_order_acquire)<2);
// ...
}

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 161
```

If you use read-modify-write operations, it’s important to pick which semantics you
desire. In this case, you want both acquire and release semantics, so memory_order
_acq_rel is appropriate, but you can use other orderings too. A fetch_sub operation
with memory_order_acquire semantics doesn’t synchronize with anything, even though
it stores a value, because it isn’t a release operation. Likewise, a store can’t synchronize
with a fetch_or with memory_order_release semantics, because the read part of the
fetch_or isn’t an acquire operation. Read-modify-write operations with memory_order
_acq_rel semantics behave as both an acquire and a release, so a prior store can synchronize with such an operation, and it can synchronize with a subsequent load, as is
the case in this example.
If you mix acquire-release operations with sequentially consistent operations, the
sequentially consistent loads behave like loads with acquire semantics, and sequentially consistent stores behave like stores with release semantics. Sequentially consistent read-modify-write operations behave as both acquire and release operations.
Relaxed operations are still relaxed but are bound by the additional synchronizes-with
and consequent happens-before relationships introduced through the use of acquirerelease semantics.
Despite the potentially non-intuitive outcomes, anyone who’s used locks has had to
deal with the same ordering issues: locking a mutex is an acquire operation, and
unlocking the mutex is a release operation. With mutexes, you learn that you must
ensure that the same mutex is locked when you read a value as was locked when you
wrote it, and the same applies here; your acquire and release operations have to be on
the same variable to ensure an ordering. If data is protected with a mutex, the exclusive nature of the lock means that the result is indistinguishable from what it would
have been had the lock and unlock been sequentially consistent operations. Similarly,
if you use acquire and release orderings on atomic variables to build a simple lock,
then from the point of view of code that uses the lock, the behavior will appear
sequentially consistent, even though the internal operations are not.
If you don’t need the stringency of sequentially consistent ordering for your
atomic operations, the pairwise synchronization of acquire-release ordering has the
potential for a much lower synchronization cost than the global ordering required for
sequentially consistent operations. The trade-off here is the mental cost required to
ensure that the ordering works correctly and that the non-intuitive behavior across
threads isn’t problematic.
DATA DEPENDENCY WITH ACQUIRE-RELEASE ORDERING AND MEMORY_ORDER_CONSUME
In the introduction to this section I said that memory_order_consume was part of the
acquire-release ordering model, but it was conspicuously absent from the preceding
description. This is because memory_order_consume is special: it’s all about data
dependencies, and it introduces the data-dependency nuances to the inter-thread
happens-before relationship mentioned in section 5.3.2. It is also special in that the
C++17 standard explicitly recommends that you do not use it. It is therefore only covered here for completeness: you should not use memory_order_consume in your code!

162 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
The concept of a data dependency is relatively straightforward: there is a data
dependency between two operations if the second one operates on the result of the
first. There are two new relations that deal with data dependencies: dependency-orderedbefore and carries-a-dependency-to. Like sequenced-before, carries-a-dependency-to applies
strictly within a single thread and models the data dependency between operations; if
the result of an operation (A) is used as an operand for an operation (B), then A carries a dependency to B. If the result of operation A is a value of a scalar type such as an
int, then the relationship still applies if the result of A is stored in a variable, and that
variable is then used as an operand for operation B. This operation is also transitive,
so if A carries a dependency to B, and B carries a dependency to C, then A carries a
dependency to C.
On the other hand, the dependency-ordered-before relationship can apply
between threads. It’s introduced by using atomic load operations tagged with memory
_order_consume. This is a special case of memory_order_acquire that limits the synchronized data to direct dependencies; a store operation (A) tagged with memory_
order_release, memory_order_acq_rel, or memory_order_seq_cst is dependencyordered-before a load operation (B) tagged with memory_order_consume if the consume
reads the value stored. This is as opposed to the synchronizes-with relationship you get
if the load uses memory_order_acquire. If this operation (B) then carries a dependency to some operation (C), then A is also dependency-ordered-before C.
This wouldn’t do you any good for synchronization purposes if it didn’t affect the
inter-thread happens-before relation, but it does: if A is dependency-ordered-before
B, then A also inter-thread happens-before B.
One important use for this kind of memory ordering is where the atomic operation loads a pointer to some data. By using memory_order_consume on the load and
memory_order_release on the prior store, you ensure that the pointed-to data is correctly synchronized, without imposing any synchronization requirements on any other
nondependent data. The following listing shows an example of this scenario.
```cpp
Listing5.10 Using std::memory_order_consume to synchronize data
struct X
{
int i;
std::string s;
```

};
```cpp
std::atomic<X*> p;
std::atomic<int> a;
void create_x()
{
X* x=new X;
x->i=42;
```

B
```cpp
x->s=”hello”;
a.store(99,std::memory_order_relaxed);
p.store(x,std::memory_order_release);
}

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 163
void use_x()
{
```

X* x;
```cpp
while(!(x=p.load(std::memory_order_consume)))
std::this_thread::sleep(std::chrono::microseconds(1));
```

e
```cpp
assert(x->i==42);
- assert(x->s==”hello”);
assert(a.load(std::memory_order_relaxed)==99);
} g
int main()
{
std::thread t1(create_x);
std::thread t2(use_x);
t1.join();
t2.join();
}
B c
```

Even though the store to a is sequenced before the store to p , and the store to p
is tagged memory_order_release, the load of p is tagged memory_order_consume.
This means that the store to p only happens before those expressions that are dependent on the value loaded from p. This means that the asserts on the data members
e - of the X structure ( and ) are guaranteed not to fire, because the load of p carries a dependency to those expressions through the variable x. On the other hand,
g
the assert on the value of a may or may not fire; this operation isn’t dependent
on the value loaded from p, and so there’s no guarantee on the value that’s read.
This is particularly apparent because it’s tagged with memory_order_relaxed, as
you’ll see.
Sometimes, you don’t want the overhead of carrying the dependency around. You
want the compiler to be able to cache values in registers and reorder operations to
optimize the code rather than fussing about the dependencies. In these scenarios, you
can use std::kill_dependency() to explicitly break the dependency chain. std::
kill_dependency() is a simple function template that copies the supplied argument to
the return value but breaks the dependency chain in doing so. For example, if you have
a global read-only array, and you use std::memory_order_consume when retrieving an
index into that array from another thread, you can use std::kill_dependency() to let
the compiler know that it doesn’t need to reread the contents of the array entry, as in
the following example:
```cpp
int global_data[]={ … };
std::atomic<int> index;
void f()
{
int i=index.load(std::memory_order_consume);
do_something_with(global_data[std::kill_dependency(i)]);
}
```

In real code, you should always use memory_order_acquire where you might be
tempted to use memory_order_consume, and std::kill_dependency is unnecessary.

164 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
Now that I’ve covered the basics of the memory orderings, it’s time to look at the
more complex parts of the synchronizes-with relation, which manifest in the form of
release sequences.
### 5.3.4 Release sequences and synchronizes-with

Back in section 5.3.1, I mentioned that you could get a synchronizes-with relationship
between a store to an atomic variable and a load of that atomic variable from another
thread, even when there’s a sequence of read-modify-write operations between the
store and the load, provided all the operations are suitably tagged. Now that I’ve covered the possible memory-ordering “tags,” I can elaborate on this. If the store is tagged
with memory_order_release, memory_order_acq_rel, or memory_order_seq_cst, and
the load is tagged with memory_order_consume, memory_order_acquire, or memory
_order_seq_cst, and each operation in the chain loads the value written by the previous operation, then the chain of operations constitutes a release sequence and the initial store synchronizes with (for memory_order_acquire or memory_order_seq_cst)
or is dependency-ordered-before (for memory_order_consume) the final load. Any
atomic read-modify-write operations in the chain can have any memory ordering
(even memory_order_relaxed).
To see what this means and why it’s important, consider atomic<int> being used
as a count of the number of items in a shared queue, as in the following listing.
Listing5.11 Reading values from a queue with atomic operations
```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
std::vector<int> queue_data;
std::atomic<int> count;
void populate_queue()
{
unsigned const number_of_items=20;
queue_data.clear();
for(unsigned i=0;i<number_of_items;++i)
{
queue_data.push_back(i);
}
```

b
The initial
store
```cpp
count.store(number_of_items,std::memory_order_release);
}
void consume_queue_items()
{
while(true) An RMW
```

{ operation
```cpp
int item_index;
if((item_index=count.fetch_sub(1,std::memory_order_acquire))<=0)
{
wait_for_more_items();
Wait for
```

continue; d
more items.
```cpp
}

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 165
process(queue_data[item_index-1]);
```

Reading
```cpp
}
```

queue_data
} e
is safe.
```cpp
int main()
{
std::thread a(populate_queue);
std::thread b(consume_queue_items);
std::thread c(consume_queue_items);
a.join();
b.join();
c.join();
}
```

One way to handle things would be to have the thread that’s producing the data store
the items in a shared buffer and then do count.store(number_of_items, memory_
B
order_release) to let the other threads know that data is available. The threads
consuming the queue items might then do count.fetch_sub(1,memory_order_
c e
acquire) to claim an item from the queue, prior to reading the shared buffer .
Once the count becomes zero, there are no more items, and the thread must wait .
If there’s one consumer thread, this is fine; fetch_sub() is a read with memory
_order_acquire semantics, and the store had memory_order_release semantics, so
the store synchronizes with the load and the thread can read the item from the buffer.
If there are two threads reading, the second fetch_sub() will see the value written by
the first and not the value written by the store. Without the rule about the release
sequence, this second thread wouldn’t have a happens-before relationship with the
first thread, and it wouldn’t be safe to read the shared buffer unless the first fetch_
sub() also had memory_order_release semantics, which would introduce unnecessary
synchronization between the two consumer threads. Without the release sequence
rule or memory_order_release on the fetch_sub operations, there would be nothing
to require that the stores to the queue_data were visible to the second consumer, and
you would have a data race. Thankfully, the first fetch_sub() does participate in the
release sequence, and so the store() synchronizes with the second fetch_sub().
There’s still no synchronizes-with relationship between the two consumer threads.
This is shown in figure 5.7. The dotted lines in figure 5.7 show the release sequence,
and the solid lines show the happens-before relationships.
There can be any number of links in the chain, but provided they’re all readmodify-write operations such as fetch_sub(), the store() will still synchronize with
each one that’s tagged memory_order_acquire. In this example, all the links are the
same, and all are acquire operations, but they could be a mix of different operations
with different memory-ordering semantics.
Although most of the synchronization relationships come from the memoryordering semantics applied to operations on atomic variables, it’s also possible to
introduce additional ordering constraints by using fences.

Figure 5.7 The release sequence for the queue operations from listing 5.11 5.3.5 Fences
An atomic operations library wouldn’t be complete without a set of fences. These are
operations that enforce memory-ordering constraints without modifying any data and
are typically combined with atomic operations that use the memory_order_relaxed
ordering constraints. Fences are global operations and affect the ordering of other
atomic operations in the thread that executed the fence. Fences are also commonly
called memory barriers, and they get their name because they put a line in the code that
certain operations can’t cross. As you may recall from section 5.3.3, relaxed operations
on separate variables can usually be freely reordered by the compiler or the hardware.
Fences restrict this freedom and introduce happens-before and synchronizes-with
relationships that weren’t present before.
Let’s start by adding a fence between the two atomic operations on each thread in
listing 5.5, as shown in the following listing.
Listing5.12 Relaxed operations can be ordered with fences
```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <assert.h>
std::atomic<bool> x,y;
std::atomic<int> z;
void write_x_then_y()

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 167
{
```

b
```cpp
x.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);
std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);
y.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);
}
void read_y_then_x()
```

e
```cpp
{
while(!y.load(std::memory_order_relaxed));
- std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);
if(x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed))
```

++z; g
```cpp
}
int main()
{
x=false;
y=false;
z=0;
std::thread a(write_x_then_y);
std::thread b(read_y_then_x);
a.join();
b.join();
```

h
```cpp
assert(z.load()!=0);
}
```

c - The release fence synchronizes with the acquire fence because the load from y
e d B
at reads the value stored at . This means that the store to x at happens before
g h
the load from x at , so the value read must be true and the assert at won’t fire.
This is in contrast to the original case without the fences where the store to and load
from x weren’t ordered, and so the assert could fire. Note that both fences are necessary: you need a release in one thread and an acquire in another to get a synchronizeswith relationship.
c d
In this case, the release fence has the same effect as if the store to y was
tagged with memory_order_release rather than memory_order_relaxed. Likewise, the
- e
acquire fence makes it as if the load from y was tagged with memory_order_
acquire. This is the general idea with fences: if an acquire operation sees the result of
a store that takes place after a release fence, the fence synchronizes with that acquire
operation; and if a load that takes place before an acquire fence sees the result of a
release operation, the release operation synchronizes with the acquire fence. You can
have fences on both sides, as in the example here, in which case if a load that takes
place before the acquire fence sees a value written by a store that takes place after the
release fence, the release fence synchronizes with the acquire fence.
Although the fence synchronization depends on the values read or written by
operations before or after the fence, it’s important to note that the synchronization
point is the fence itself. If you take write_x_then_y from listing 5.12 and move the
write to x after the fence as follows, the condition in the assert is no longer guaranteed
to be true, even though the write to x comes before the write to y:

168 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
```cpp
void write_x_then_y()
{
std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);
x.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);
y.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);
}
```

These two operations are no longer separated by the fence and so are no longer
ordered. It’s only when the fence comes between the store to x and the store to y that
it imposes an ordering. The presence or absence of a fence doesn’t affect any
enforced orderings on happens-before relationships that exist because of other
atomic operations.
This example, and almost every other example so far in this chapter, is built
entirely from variables with an atomic type. But the real benefit of using atomic operations to enforce an ordering is that they can enforce an ordering on non-atomic operations and avoid the undefined behavior of a data race, as you saw back in listing 5.2.
### 5.3.6 Ordering non-atomic operations with atomics

If you replace x from listing 5.12 with an ordinary non-atomic bool (as in the following listing), the behavior is guaranteed to be the same.
Listing5.13 Enforcing ordering on non-atomic operations
```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
```

b
```cpp
#include <assert.h> x is now a plain
```

non-atomic variable.
```cpp
bool x=false;
std::atomic<bool> y;
std::atomic<int> z;
void write_x_then_y() c Store to x before
```

{ the fence
```cpp
x=true;
std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release); Store to y after
the fence
y.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);
}
void read_y_then_x()
```

{ Wait until you s c ee
the write from .
```cpp
while(!y.load(std::memory_order_relaxed));
std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);
if(x)
```

++z; This will read the
e B
} value written by .
```cpp
int main()
{
x=false;
y=false;
z=0;
std::thread a(write_x_then_y);
std::thread b(read_y_then_x);
a.join();

Synchronizing operations and enforcing ordering 169
b.join();
```

- assert(z.load()!=0); This assert won’t fire.
```cpp
}
```

B
The fences still provide an enforced ordering of the store to x and the store to y
c d e
, and the load from y and the load from x , and there’s still a happens-before
- relationship between the store to x and the load from x, so the assert still won’t fire.
c d
The store to and load from y still have to be atomic; otherwise, there would be a
data race on y, but the fences enforce an ordering on the operations on x, once the
reading thread has seen the stored value of y. This enforced ordering means that
there’s no data race on x, even though it’s modified by one thread and read by
another.
It’s not only fences that can order non-atomic operations. You saw the ordering
effects back in listing 5.10 with a memory_order_release/memory_order_consume pair
ordering non-atomic accesses to a dynamically allocated object, and many of the
examples in this chapter could be rewritten with some of the memory_order_relaxed
operations replaced with plain non-atomic operations instead.
### 5.3.7 Ordering non-atomic operations

Ordering of non-atomic operations through the use of atomic operations is where the
sequenced-before part of happens-before becomes so important. If a non-atomic
operation is sequenced before an atomic operation, and that atomic operation happens before an operation in another thread, the non-atomic operation also happens
before that operation in the other thread. This is where the ordering of the operations on x in listing 5.13 comes from and why the example in listing 5.2 works. This is
also the basis for the higher-level synchronization facilities in the C++ Standard
Library, such as mutexes and condition variables. To see how this works, consider the
simple spinlock mutex from listing 5.1.
The lock() operation is a loop on flag.test_and_set() using std::memory_
order_acquire ordering, and the unlock() is a call to flag.clear() with std::memory
_order_release ordering. When the first thread calls lock(), the flag is initially clear,
so the first call to test_and_set() will set the flag and return false, indicating that
this thread now has the lock, and terminating the loop. The thread is then free to
modify any data protected by the mutex. Any other thread that calls lock() at this
time will find the flag already set and will be blocked in the test_and_set() loop.
When the thread with the lock has finished modifying the protected data, it calls
```cpp
unlock(), which calls flag.clear() with std::memory_order_release semantics.
```

This then synchronizes (see section 5.3.1) with a subsequent call to flag.test
_and_set() from an invocation of lock() on another thread, because this call has
std::memory_order_acquire semantics. Because the modification of the protected
data is necessarily sequenced before the unlock() call, this modification happens
before the unlock() and thus happens before the subsequent lock() call from the
second thread (because of the synchronizes with relationship between the unlock()

170 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
and the lock()) and happens before any accesses to that data from this second thread
once it has acquired the lock.
Although other mutex implementations will have different internal operations,
the basic principle is the same: lock() is an acquire operation on an internal memory
location, and unlock() is a release operation on that same memory location.
Each of the synchronization mechanisms described in chapters 2, 3, and 4 will provide ordering guarantees in terms of the synchronizes-with relationship. This is what
enables you to use them to synchronize your data, and provide ordering guarantees.
The following are the synchronization relationships provided by these facilities:
```cpp
std::thread
```

- The completion of the std::thread constructor synchronizes with the invocation of the supplied function or callable object on the new thread.
- The completion of a thread synchronizes with the return from a successful call
to join on the std::thread object that owns that thread.
```cpp
std::mutex, std::timed_mutex, std::recursive_mutex, std::recursive_timed_mutex
```

- All calls to lock and unlock, and successful calls to try_lock, try_lock_for, or
try_lock_until, on a given mutex object form a single total order: the lock order
of the mutex.
- A call to unlock on a given mutex object synchronizes with a subsequent call to
lock, or a subsequent successful call to try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_
lock_until, on that object in the lock order of the mutex.
- Failed calls to try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_lock_until do not participate
in any synchronization relationships.
```cpp
std::shared_mutex, std::shared_timed_mutex
```

- All calls to lock, unlock, lock_shared, and unlock_shared, and successful calls
to try_lock, try_lock_for, try_lock_until, try_lock_shared, try_lock_
shared_for, or try_lock_shared_until, on a given mutex object form a single
total order: the lock order of the mutex.
- A call to unlock on a given mutex object synchronizes with a subsequent call to
lock or shared_lock, or a successful call to try_lock, try_lock_for, try_
lock_until, try_lock_shared, try_lock_shared_for, or try_lock_shared
_until, on that object in the lock order of the mutex.
- Failed calls to try_lock, try_lock_for, try_lock_until, try_lock_shared,
try_lock_shared_for, or try_lock_shared_until do not participate in any
synchronization relationships.
```cpp
std::promise, std::future AND std::shared_future
```

- The successful completion of a call to set_value or set_exception on a given
std::promise object synchronizes with a successful return from a call to wait
or get, or a call to wait_for or wait_until that returns std::future_status::
ready on a future that shares the same asynchronous state as the promise.

- The destructor of a given std::promise object that stores an std::future_error
exception in the shared asynchronous state associated with the promise synchronizes with a successful return from a call to wait or get, or a call to wait_for or
wait_until that returns std::future_status::ready on a future that shares the
same asynchronous state as the promise.
```cpp
std::packaged_task, std::future AND std::shared_future
```

- The successful completion of a call to the function call operator of a given
std::packaged_task object synchronizes with a successful return from a call to
wait or get, or a call to wait_for or wait_until that returns std::future
_status::ready on a future that shares the same asynchronous state as the
packaged task.
- The destructor of a given std::packaged_task object that stores an std::
future_error exception in the shared asynchronous state associated with the
packaged task synchronizes with a successful return from a call to wait or get,
or a call to wait_for or wait_until that returns std::future_status::ready
on a future that shares the same asynchronous state as the packaged task.
```cpp
std::async, std::future AND std::shared_future
```

- The completion of the thread running a task launched via a call to std::async
with a policy of std::launch::async synchronizes with a successful return from
a call to wait or get, or a call to wait_for or wait_until that returns
std::future_status::ready on a future that shares the same asynchronous
state as the spawned task.
- The completion of a task launched via a call to std::async with a policy of
std::launch::deferred synchronizes with a successful return from a call to wait
or get, or a call to wait_for or wait_until that returns std::future_status
::ready on a future that shares the same asynchronous state as the promise.
```cpp
std::experimental::future, std::experimental::shared_future AND CONTINUATIONS
```

- The event that causes an asynchronous shared state to become ready synchronizes with the invocation of a continuation function scheduled on that
shared state.
- The completion of a continuation function synchronizes with a successful
return from a call to wait or get, or a call to wait_for or wait_until that
returns std::future_status::ready on a future that shares the same asynchronous state as the future returned from the call to then that scheduled the
continuation, or the invocation of any continuation scheduled on that future.
```cpp
std::experimental::latch
```

- The invocation of each call to count_down or count_down_and_wait on a given
instance of std::experimental::latch synchronizes with the completion of
each successful call to wait or count_down_and_wait on that latch.

172 CHAPTER 5 The C++ memory model and operations on atomic types
```cpp
std::experimental::barrier
```

- The invocation of each call to arrive_and_wait or arrive_and_drop on a
given instance of std::experimental::barrier synchronizes with the completion of each subsequent successful call to arrive_and_wait on that barrier.
```cpp
std::experimental::flex_barrier
```

- The invocation of each call to arrive_and_wait or arrive_and_drop on a given
instance of std::experimental::flex_barrier synchronizes with the completion of each subsequent successful call to arrive_and_wait on that barrier.
- The invocation of each call to arrive_and_wait or arrive_and_drop on a
given instance of std::experimental::flex_barrier synchronizes with the
subsequent invocation of the completion function on that barrier.
- The return from the completion function on a given instance of std::
experimental::flex_barrier synchronizes with the completion of each call to
arrive_and_wait on that barrier that was blocked waiting for that barrier when
the completion function was invoked.
```cpp
std::condition_variable AND std::condition_variable_any
```

- Condition variables do not provide any synchronization relationships. They are
optimizations over busy-wait loops, and all the synchronization is provided by
the operations on the associated mutex.
### Summary

In this chapter I’ve covered the low-level details of the C++ memory model and the
atomic operations that provide the basis for synchronization between threads. This
includes the basic atomic types provided by specializations of the std::atomic<> class
template as well as the generic atomic interface provided by the primary std::atomic<>
template and the std::experimental::atomic_shared_ptr<> template, the operations on these types, and the complex details of the various memory-ordering options.
We’ve also looked at fences and how they can be paired with operations on atomic
types to enforce an ordering. Finally, we’ve come back to the beginning with a look at
how the atomic operations can be used to enforce an ordering between non-atomic
operations on separate threads, and the synchronization relationships provided by the
higher-level facilities.
In the next chapter we’ll look at using the high-level synchronization facilities
alongside atomic operations to design efficient containers for concurrent access, and
we’ll write algorithms that process data in parallel.
