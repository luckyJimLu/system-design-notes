# Appendix A: Brief reference for some C++11 language features

Brief reference for some
C++11 language features

The new C++ Standard brings more than just concurrency support; there are a host
of other language features and new libraries as well. In this appendix I give a brief
overview of the new language features that are used in the Thread Library and the
rest of the book. Aside from thread_local (which is covered in section A.8), none
of them are directly related to concurrency, though they are important and/or useful for multithreaded code. I’ve limited this list to those that are either necessary
(such  as  rvalue  references)  or  serve  to  make  the  code  simpler  or  easier  to  understand. Code that uses these features may be difficult to understand at first because of
lack of familiarity, but as you become familiar with them, they should generally make
code easier to understand. As the use of C++11 becomes more widespread, code making use of these features will become more common.

  Without  further  ado,  let’s  start  by  looking  at  rvalue  references,  which  are  used
extensively by the Thread Library to facilitate the transfer of ownership (of threads,
locks, or whatever) between objects.

A.1

Rvalue references
If you’ve been doing C++ programming for any time, you’ll be familiar with references;  C++  references  allow  you  to  create  a  new  name  for  an  existing  object.  All
accesses and modifications done through the new reference affect the original; for
example:

```cpp
int var=42;
int& ref=var;
ref=99;
assert(var==99);

Create a reference
to var.

Original updated because
of assignment to reference

Rvalue references
```

The only references that existed prior to C++11 are lvalue references—references to lvalues. The term lvalue comes from C and refers to things that can be on the left side of
an assignment expression, named objects, objects allocated on the stack or heap, or
members of other objects, all things with a defined storage location. The term rvalue
also  comes  from  C  and  refers  to  things  that  can  occur  only  on  the  right  side  of  an
assignment expression—literals and temporaries, for example. Lvalue references can
only be bound to lvalues, not rvalues. You can’t write

```cpp
int& i=42;
```

Won’t compile

for example, because 42 is an rvalue. OK, that’s not quite true; you’ve always been able
to bind an rvalue to a const lvalue reference:

```cpp
int const& i=42;
```

But this is a deliberate exception on the part of the standard, introduced before we
had rvalue references in order to allow you to pass temporaries to functions taking references. This allows implicit conversions, so you can write things like this:

```cpp
void print(std::string const& s);
print("hello");

Create temporary
std::string object
```

The C++11 Standard introduced rvalue references, which bind only to rvalues, not to lvalues, and are declared with two ampersands rather than one:

```cpp
int&& i=42;
int j=42;
int&& k=j;
```

Won’t
compile

You can use function overloading to determine whether function parameters are lvalues or rvalues by having one overload take an lvalue reference and another take an
rvalue reference. This is the cornerstone of move semantics.

A.1.1 Move semantics

Rvalues are typically temporary and so can be freely modified; if you know that your
function parameter is an rvalue, you can use it as temporary storage, or “steal” its contents without affecting program correctness. This means that rather than copying the
contents of an rvalue parameter, you can move the contents. For large dynamic structures, this saves a lot of memory allocation and provides a lot of scope for optimization. Consider a function that takes an std::vector<int> as a parameter and needs
to have an internal copy for modification, without touching the original. The old way
of doing this would be to take the parameter as a const lvalue reference and make the
copy internally:

```cpp
void process_copy(std::vector<int> const& vec_)
{

     std::vector<int> vec(vec_);
     vec.push_back(42);
}
```

This allows the function to take both lvalues and rvalues but forces the copy in every
case. If you overload the function with a version that takes an rvalue reference, you
can  avoid  the  copy  in  the  rvalue  case,  because  you  know  you  can  freely  modify  the
original:

```cpp
void process_copy(std::vector<int> && vec)
{
     vec.push_back(42);
}
```

Now,  if  the  function  in  question  is  the  constructor  of  your  class,  you  can  pilfer  the
innards of the rvalue and use them for your new instance. Consider the class in the
following  listing.  In  the  default  constructor  it  allocates  a  large  chunk  of  memory,
which is freed in the destructor.

Listing A.1 A class with a move constructor

```cpp
class X
{
```

private:
```cpp
    int* data;
```

public:
    X():
        data(new int[1000000])
```cpp
    {}
    ~X()
    {
        delete [] data;
    }
```

    X(const X& other):
        data(new int[1000000])
```cpp
    {
        std::copy(other.data,other.data+1000000,data);
    }
```

    X(X&& other):
        data(other.data)
```cpp
    {
        other.data=nullptr;
    }
```

};

B

The copy constructor B is defined as you might expect: allocate a new block of memory
and copy the data across. But you also have a new constructor that takes the old value
by rvalue reference c. This is the move constructor. In this case you copy the pointer to
the data and leave the other instance with a null pointer, saving yourself a huge chunk
of memory and time when creating variables from rvalues.

Rvalue references

  For  class  X  the  move  constructor  is  an  optimization,  but  in  some  cases  it  makes
sense  to  provide  a  move  constructor  even  when  it  doesn’t  make  sense  to  provide  a
copy  constructor.  For  example,  the  whole  point  of  std::unique_ptr<>  is  that  each
non-null  instance  is  the  one  and  only  pointer  to  its  object,  so  a  copy  constructor
makes no sense. But a move constructor allows ownership of the pointer to be transferred  between  instances  and  permits  std::unique_ptr<>  to  be  used  as  a  function
```cpp
return value—the pointer is moved rather than copied.
```

 If you want to explicitly move from a named object that you know you’ll no longer
use,  you  can  cast  it  to  an  rvalue  either  by  using  static_cast<X&&>  or  by  calling
```cpp
std::move():
```

X x1;
```cpp
X x2=std::move(x1);
X x3=static_cast<X&&>(x2);
```

This  can  be  beneficial  when  you  want  to  move  the  parameter  value  into  a  local  or
member  variable  without  copying,  because  although  an  rvalue  reference  parameter
can bind to rvalues, within the function it is treated as an lvalue:

```cpp
void do_stuff(X&& x_)
{
    X a(x_);
    X b(std::move(x_));
}
do_stuff(X());
```

X x;
```cpp
do_stuff(x);
```

Copies

Moves

OK; rvalue binds to
rvalue reference

Error; lvalue can’t bind
to rvalue reference

Move semantics are used extensively in the Thread Library, both where copies make
no  semantic  sense  but  resources  can  be  transferred,  and  as  an  optimization  to  avoid
expensive copies where the source is going to be destroyed anyway. You saw an example
of this in section 2.2 where you used  std::move() to transfer an  std::unique_ptr<>
instance  into  a  newly  constructed  thread,  and  then  again  in  section  2.3  where  we
looked at transferring the ownership of threads between std::thread instances.

```cpp
 std::thread, std::unique_lock<>, std::future<>, std::promise<>, and std::
```

packaged_task<>  can’t  be  copied,  but  they  all  have  move  constructors  to  allow  the
associated resource to be transferred between instances and support their use as function return values. std::string and std::vector<> both can be copied as always, but
they  also  have  move  constructors  and  move-assignment  operators  to  avoid  copying
large quantities of data from an rvalue.

 The C++ Standard Library never does anything with an object that has been explicitly moved into another object, except destroy it or assign to it (either with a copy or,
more likely, a move). But it’s good practice to ensure that the invariant of the class
encompasses  the  moved-from  state.  An  std::thread  instance  that  has  been  used  as
the source of a move is equivalent to a default-constructed std::thread instance, for
example, and an instance of std::string that has been used as the source of a move

will still have a valid state, although no guarantees are made as to what that state is (in
terms of how long the string is or what characters it contains).

A.1.2 Rvalue references and function templates

There’s a final nuance when you use rvalue references for parameters to a function
template: if the function parameter is an rvalue reference to a template parameter,
automatic template argument type deduction deduces the type to be an lvalue reference if an lvalue is supplied or a plain unadorned type if an rvalue is supplied. That’s
a bit of a mouthful, so let’s look at an example. Consider the following function:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void foo(T&& t)
{}
```

If you call it with an rvalue as follows, then T is deduced to be the type of the value:

Calls foo<int>(42)

```cpp
foo(42);
foo(3.14159);
foo(std::string());

Calls foo<double>(3.14159)

Calls foo<std::string>(std::string())
```

But if you call foo with an lvalue, T is deduced to be an lvalue reference:

```cpp
int i=42;
foo(i);

Calls foo<int&>(i)
```

Because the function parameter is declared as T&&, this is therefore a reference to a reference, which is treated as the original reference type. The signature of foo<int&>() is

```cpp
void foo<int&>(int& t);
```

This  allows  a  single  function  template  to  accept  both  lvalue  and  rvalue  parameters
and is used by the std::thread constructor (sections 2.1 and 2.2) so that the supplied
callable object can be moved into internal storage rather than copied if the parameter
is an rvalue.

Deleted functions
Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to allow a class to be copied. std::mutex is a prime
example of this—what would it mean if you did copy a mutex? std::unique_lock<> is
another—an instance is the one and only owner of the lock it holds. To truly copy it
would mean that the copy also held the lock, which doesn’t make sense. Moving ownership  between  instances,  as  described  in  section  A.1.2,  makes  sense,  but  that’s  not
copying. I’m sure you’ve seen other examples.

 The standard idiom for preventing copies of a class used to be declaring the copy
constructor and copy assignment operator private and then not providing an implementation. This would cause a compile error if any code outside the class in question

A.2

Deleted functions

tried to copy an instance and a link-time error (due to lack of an implementation) if
any of the class’s member functions or friends tried to copy an instance:

```cpp
class no_copies
{
```

public:
```cpp
    no_copies(){}
```

private:
```cpp
    no_copies(no_copies const&);
    no_copies& operator=(no_copies const&);
```

};
no_copies a;
```cpp
no_copies b(a);
```

Won’t compile

No implementation

With C++11, the committee realized that this was a common idiom but also realized
that it’s a bit of a hack. The committee therefore provided a more general mechanism
that can be applied in other cases too: you can declare a function as deleted by adding =
delete to the function declaration. no_copies can be written as

```cpp
class no_copies
{
```

public:
```cpp
    no_copies(){}
    no_copies(no_copies const&) = delete;
    no_copies& operator=(no_copies const&) = delete;
```

};

This is much more descriptive than the original code and clearly expresses the intent.
It  also  allows  the  compiler  to  give  more  descriptive  error  messages  and  moves  the
error from link time to compile time if you try to perform the copy within a member
function of your class.

 If, in addition to deleting the copy constructor and copy-assignment operator, you
also  explicitly  write  a  move  constructor  and  move-assignment  operator,  your  class
becomes move-only, the same as std::thread and std::unique_lock<>. The following listing shows an example of this move-only type.

Listing A.2 A simple move-only type

```cpp
class move_only
{
    std::unique_ptr<my_class> data;
```

public:
```cpp
    move_only(const move_only&) = delete;
```

    move_only(move_only&& other):
```cpp
        data(std::move(other.data))
    {}
    move_only& operator=(const move_only&) = delete;
    move_only& operator=(move_only&& other)
    {
        data=std::move(other.data);
        return *this;

    }
```

};
move_only m1;
```cpp
move_only m2(m1);
move_only m3(std::move(m1));
```

Error; copy constructor
is declared deleted

OK; move constructor found

Move-only objects can be passed as function parameters and returned from functions,
but  if  you  want  to  move  from  an  lvalue,  you  always  have  to  be  explicit  and  use
```cpp
std::move() or a static_cast<T&&>.
```

 You can apply the  =  delete specifier to any function, not just copy constructors
and assignment operators. This makes it clear that the function isn’t available. It does
a bit more than that too, though; a deleted function participates in overload resolution in the normal way and only causes a compilation error if it’s selected. This can be
used to remove specific overloads. For example, if your function takes a short parameter, you can prevent the narrowing of int values by writing an overload that takes an
int and declaring it deleted:

```cpp
void foo(short);
void foo(int) = delete;
```

Any attempts to call foo with an int will now be met with a compilation error, and the
caller will have to explicitly cast supplied values to short:

```cpp
foo(42);
foo((short)42);
```

Error; int overload
declared deleted

OK

A.3

Defaulted functions
Whereas deleted functions allow you to explicitly declare that a function isn’t implemented,  defaulted  functions  are  the  opposite  extreme:  they  allow  you  to  specify  that
the compiler should write the function for you, with its “default” implementation. You
can only do this for functions that the compiler can autogenerate anyway: default constructors,  destructors,  copy  constructors,  move  constructors,  copy-assignment  operators, and move-assignment operators.

 Why would you want to do that? There are several reasons why you might:

- In order to change the accessibility of the function—By default, the compiler-generated
functions  are  public.  If  you  want  to  make  them  protected  or  even  private,
you must write them yourself. By declaring them as defaulted, you can get the
compiler to write the function and change the access level.

- As  documentation—If  the  compiler-generated  version  is  sufficient,  it  might  be
worth explicitly declaring it as such so that when you or someone else looks at
the code later, it’s clear that this was intended.
In order to force the compiler to generate the function when it would not otherwise have
done so—This is typically done with default constructors, which are only normally

- Defaulted functions

compiler-generated  if  there  are  no  user-defined  constructors.  If  you  need  to
define a custom copy constructor (for example), you can still get a compilergenerated default constructor by declaring it as defaulted.
In order to make a destructor virtual while leaving it as compiler-generated.

- - To force a particular declaration of the copy constructor, such as having it take the source

parameter by a non-const reference rather than by a const reference.

- To take advantage of the special properties of the compiler-generated function, which are

lost if you provide an implementation—More on this in a moment.

Just  as  deleted  functions  are  declared  by  following  the  declaration  with  =  delete,
defaulted functions are declared by following the declaration by = default; for example:

Change access

```cpp
class Y
{
```

private:
```cpp
    Y() = default;
```

public:
```cpp
    Y(Y&) = default;
    T& operator=(const Y&) = default;
```

protected:
```cpp
    virtual ~Y() = default;
```

};

Take a non-const
reference

Change access
and add virtual

Declare as defaulted
for documentation

I mentioned previously that compiler-generated functions can have special properties
that you can’t get from a user-defined version. The biggest difference is that a compilergenerated function can be trivial. This has a few consequences, including the following:

- Objects  with  trivial  copy  constructors,  trivial  copy  assignment  operators,  and

trivial destructors can be copied with memcpy or memmove.

- Literal types used for constexpr functions (see section A.4) must have a trivial

constructor, copy constructor, and destructor.

- Classes  with  a  trivial  default  constructor,  copy  constructor,  copy  assignment
operator, and destructor can be used in a union with a user-defined constructor
and destructor.

- Classes with trivial copy assignment operators can be used with the std::atomic<>
class template (see section 5.2.6) in order to provide a value of that type with
atomic operations.

Just declaring the function as = default doesn’t make it trivial—it will only be trivial if
the class also supports all the other criteria for the corresponding function to be trivial—but explicitly writing the function in user code does prevent it from being trivial.

  The  second  difference  between  classes  with  compiler-generated  functions  and
user-supplied equivalents is that a class with no user-supplied constructors can be an
aggregate and thus can be initialized with an aggregate initializer:

```cpp
struct aggregate
{
    aggregate() = default;

    aggregate(aggregate const&) = default;
    int a;
    double b;
```

};
```cpp
aggregate x={42,3.141};
```

In this case, x.a is initialized to 42 and x.b is initialized to 3.141.

 The third difference between a compiler-generated function and a user-supplied
equivalent is quite esoteric and applies only to the default constructor and only to the
default constructor of classes that meet certain criteria. Consider the following class:

```cpp
struct X
{
    int a;
```

};

If  you  create  an  instance  of  class  X  without  an  initializer,  the  contained  int  (a)  is
default initialized. If the object has static storage duration, it’s initialized to zero; otherwise, it has an indeterminate value that can potentially cause undefined behavior if it’s
accessed before being assigned a new value:

X x1;

x1.a has an
indeterminate value.

If,  on  the  other  hand,  you  initialize  your  instance  of  X  by  explicitly  invoking  the
default constructor, then a is initialized to zero:

```cpp
X x2=X();
```

x2.a==0

This  bizarre  property  also  extends  to  base  classes  and  members.  If  your  class  has  a
compiler-generated  default  constructor  and  any  of  your  data  members  and  base
classes  also  have  a  compiler-generated  default  constructor,  data  members  of  those
bases and members that are built-in types are also either left with an indeterminate
value or initialized to zero, depending on whether or not the outer class has its default
constructor explicitly invoked.

 Although this rule is confusing and potentially error-prone, it does have its uses,
and  if  you  write  the  default  constructor  yourself,  you  lose  this  property;  either  data
members like a are always initialized (because you specify a value or explicitly default
construct) or always uninitialized (because you don’t):

```cpp
X::X():a(){}
X::X():a(42){}
X::X(){}
```

b

a==0 always.

a==42 always.

If you omit the initialization of a from the constructor of X as in the third example B,
then  a  is  left  uninitialized  for  nonstatic  instances  of  X  and  initialized  to  zero  for
instances of X with static storage duration.

constexpr functions

  Under  normal  circumstances,  if  you  write  any  other  constructor  manually,  the
compiler will no longer generate the default constructor for you, so if you want one
you have to write it, which means you lose this bizarre initialization property. But by
explicitly declaring the constructor as defaulted, you can force the compiler to generate the default constructor for you, and this property is retained:

```cpp
X::X() = default;

Default initialization
rules for a apply
```

This property is used for the atomic types (see section 5.2), which have their default
constructor explicitly defaulted. Their initial value is always undefined unless either
(a) they have static storage duration (and thus are statically initialized to zero), (b)
you explicitly invoke the default constructor to request zero initialization, or (c) you
explicitly specify a value. Note that in the case of the atomic types, the constructor for
initialization  with  a  value  is  declared  constexpr  (see  section  A.4)  in  order  to  allow
static initialization.

A.4

constexpr functions

Integer literals such as 42 are constant expressions, as are simple arithmetic expressions
such as 23*2-4. You can even use const variables of integral type that are themselves
initialized with constant expressions as part of a new constant expression:

```cpp
const int i=23;
const int two_i=i*2;
const int four=4;
const int forty_two=two_i-four;
```

Aside  from  using  constant  expressions  to  create  variables  that  can  be  used  in  other
constant expressions, there are a few things you can only do with constant expressions:

- Specify the bounds of an array:

```cpp
int bounds=99;
int array[bounds];
const int bounds2=99;
int array2[bounds2];

Error bounds is not a
constant expression
```

OK, bounds2 is a
constant expression.

- Specify the value of a nontype template parameter:

```cpp
template<unsigned size>
struct test
```

{};
```cpp
test<bounds> ia;
test<bounds2> ia2;

Error bounds is not a
constant expression
```

OK, bounds2 is a
constant expression.

- Provide an initializer for a static const class data member of integral type in

the class definition:

```cpp
class X
{
    static const int the_answer=forty_two;
```

};

- Provide an initializer for a built-in type or aggregate that can be used for static

initialization:

```cpp
struct my_aggregate
{
    int a;
    int b;
```

};
```cpp
static my_aggregate ma1={forty_two,123};
int dummy=257;
static my_aggregate ma2={dummy,dummy};

Static initialization
```

Dynamic
initialization

- Static  initialization  like  this  can  be  used  to  avoid  order-of-initialization  problems and race conditions.

None  of  this  is  new—you  could  do  all  that  with  the  1998  edition  of  the  C++  Standard.  But  with  the  C++11  Standard  what  constitutes  a  constant  expression  has  been
extended with the introduction of the  constexpr keyword. The C++14 and C++17
standards extend the constexpr facility further; a full primer is beyond the scope of
this appendix.

  The  constexpr  keyword  is  primarily  a  function  modifier.  If  the  parameter  and
return type of a function meet certain requirements and the body is sufficiently simple, a function can be declared constexpr, in which case it can be used in constant
expressions; for example:

constexpr int square(int x)
```cpp
{
    return x*x;
}
int array[square(5)];
```

In  this  case,  array  will  have  25  entries,  because  square  is  declared  constexpr.  Just
because the function can be used in a constant expression doesn’t mean that all uses
are automatically constant expressions:

```cpp
int dummy=4;
int array[square(dummy)];
```

b

Error, dummy is not a
constant expression

In this example, dummy is not a constant expression B, so square(dummy) isn’t either—
it’s a normal function call—and thus can’t be used to specify the bounds of array.

constexpr functions

A.4.1 constexpr and user-defined types
Up to now, all the examples have been with built-in types such as int. But the new C++
Standard allows constant expressions to be of any type that satisfies the requirements
for a literal type. For a class type to be classified as a literal type, the following must all
be true:

- - It must have a trivial copy constructor.
It must have a trivial destructor.

- All non-static data members and base classes must be trivial types.

- It  must  have  either  a  trivial  default  constructor  or  a  constexpr  constructor
other than the copy constructor.

We’ll look at constexpr constructors shortly. For now, we’ll focus on classes with a trivial default constructor, such as class CX in the following listing.

Listing A.3 A class with a trivial default constructor

B

```cpp
class CX
{
```

private:
```cpp
    int a;
    int b;
```

public:
```cpp
    CX() = default;
```

    CX(int a_, int b_):
        a(a_),b(b_)
```cpp
    {}
    int get_a() const
    {
        return a;
    }
    int get_b() const
    {
        return b;
    }
    int foo() const
    {
        return a+b;
    }
```

};

Note that we’ve explicitly declared the default constructor B as defaulted (see section
A.3)  in  order  to  preserve  it  as  trivial  in  the  face  of  the  user-defined  constructor c.
This type therefore fits all the qualifications for being a literal type, and you can use it
in constant expressions. You can, for example, provide a constexpr function that creates new instances:

constexpr CX create_cx()
```cpp
{
    return CX();
}
```

You can also create a simple constexpr function that copies its parameter:

constexpr CX clone(CX val)
```cpp
{
    return val;
}
```

But that’s about all you can do in C++11—a constexpr function can only call other
constexpr functions. In C++14, this restriction is lifted, and you can do almost anything in a constexpr function, provided it doesn’t modify any objects with non-local
scope. What you can do, even in C++11, is apply constexpr to the member functions
and constructor of CX:

```cpp
class CX
{
```

private:
```cpp
    int a;
    int b;
```

public:
```cpp
    CX() = default;
    constexpr CX(int a_, int b_):
        a(a_),b(b_)
    {}
    constexpr int get_a() const
    {
        return a;
    }
    constexpr int get_b()
    {
        return b;
    }
    constexpr int foo()
    {
        return a+b;
    }
```

};

b

In  C++11,  the  const  qualification  on  get_a()  B  is  now  superfluous,  because  it’s
implied by the use of constexpr, and get_b() is thus const even though the const
qualification is omitted c. In C++14, this is changed (due to the extended capabilities
of  constexpr  functions),  so  get_b()  is  no  longer  implicitly  const.  This  now  allows
more complex constexpr functions such as the following:

constexpr CX make_cx(int a)
```cpp
{
    return CX(a,1);
}
constexpr CX half_double(CX old)
{
    return CX(old.get_a()/2,old.get_b()*2);
}
constexpr int foo_squared(CX val)

constexpr functions

{
    return square(val.foo());
}
int array[foo_squared(half_double(make_cx(10)))];

49 elements
```

Interesting though this is, it’s a lot of effort to go to if all you get is a fancy way of computing some array bounds or an integral constant. The key benefit of constant expressions and constexpr functions involving user-defined types is that objects of a literal
type initialized with a constant expression are statically initialized, and so their initialization is free from race conditions and initialization order issues:

```cpp
CX si=half_double(CX(42,19));

Statically initialized
```

This  covers  constructors  too.  If  the  constructor  is  declared  constexpr  and  the  constructor parameters are constant expressions, the initialization is constant initialization
and happens as part of the static initialization phase. This is one of the most important
changes in C++11 as far as concurrency goes: by allowing user-defined constructors that
can still undergo static initialization, you can avoid any race conditions over their initialization, because they’re guaranteed to be initialized before any code is run.

  This  is  particularly  relevant  for  things  like  std::mutex  (see  section  3.2.1)  or
std::atomic<> (see section 5.2.6) where you might want to use a global instance to
synchronize  access  to  other  variables  and  avoid  race  conditions  in  that  access.  This
wouldn’t be possible if the constructor of the mutex was subject to race conditions, so
the default constructor of std::mutex is declared constexpr to ensure that mutex initialization is always done as part of the static initialization phase.

A.4.2 constexpr objects
So  far,  we’ve  looked  at  constexpr  as  applied  to  functions.  constexpr  can  also  be
applied to objects. This is primarily for diagnostic purposes; it verifies that the object
is initialized with a constant expression, constexpr constructor, or aggregate initializer made of constant expressions. It also declares the object as const:

```cpp
constexpr int i=45;
constexpr std::string s(“hello”);
int foo();
constexpr int j=foo();
```

OK

Error; foo() isn’t
declared constexpr

```cpp
Error; std::string
```

isn’t a literal type

A.4.3 constexpr function requirements
In  order  to  declare  a  function  as  constexpr  it  must  meet  a  few  requirements;  if  it
doesn’t  meet  these  requirements,  declaring  it  constexpr  is  a  compilation  error.  In
C++11, the requirements for a constexpr function were as follows:

- All parameters must be of a literal type.
- The return type must be a literal type.
- The function body must consist of a single return statement.

- The expression in the return statement must qualify as a constant expression.
- Any constructor or conversion operator used to construct the return value from

the expression must be constexpr.

This is straightforward; you must be able to inline the function into a constant expression  and  it  will  still  be  a  constant  expression,  and  you  must  not  modify  anything.
constexpr functions are pure functions with no side effects.

 In C++14, the requirements were slackened quite considerably. Though the overall
idea of a pure function with no side effects is preserved, the body is allowed to contain
considerably more:

- Multiple return statements are allowed.
- Objects created within the function can be modified.
- Loops, conditionals, and switch statements are allowed.

For constexpr class member functions there are additional requirements:

- constexpr member functions can’t be virtual.
- The class for which the function is a member must be a literal type.

The rules are different for constexpr constructors:

- The constructor body must be empty for a C++11 compiler; for a C++14 or later

compiler it must satisfy the requirements for a constexpr function.

- Every base class must be initialized.
- Every non-static data member must be initialized.
- Any expressions used in the member initialization list must qualify as constant

expressions.

- The  constructors  chosen  for  the  initialization  of  the  data  members  and  base

classes must be constexpr constructors.

- Any  constructor  or  conversion  operator  used  to  construct  the  data  members
and  base  classes  from  their  corresponding  initialization  expression  must  be
constexpr.

This is the same set of rules as for functions, except that there’s no return value, so no
return statement. Instead, the constructor initializes all the bases and data members
in the member initialization list. Trivial copy constructors are implicitly constexpr.

A.4.4 constexpr and templates
When constexpr is applied to a function template, or to a member function of a class
template, it’s ignored if the parameters and return types of a particular instantiation
of the template aren’t literal types. This allows you to write function templates that are
constexpr if the type of the template parameters is appropriate and just plain inline
functions otherwise, for example:

```cpp
template<typename T>
constexpr T sum(T a,T b)

Lambda functions

{
    return a+b;
}
constexpr int i=sum(3,42);
std::string s=
    sum(std::string("hello"),
        std::string(" world"));
```

OK; sum<int>
is constexpr.

```cpp
OK, but sum<std::string>
```

isn’t constexpr.

A.5

The  function  must  satisfy  all  the  other  requirements  for  a  constexpr  function.  You
can’t declare a function with multiple statements constexpr just because it’s a function template; that’s still a compilation error.

Lambda functions
Lambda  functions  are  one  of  the  most  exciting  features  of  the  C++11  Standard,
because  they  have  the  potential  to  greatly  simplify  code  and  eliminate  much  of  the
boilerplate associated with writing callable objects. The C++11 lambda function syntax
allows a function to be defined at the point where it’s needed in another expression.
This  works  well  for  things  like  predicates  provided  to  the  wait  functions  of  std::
condition_variable (as in the example in section 4.1.1), because it allows the semantics to be quickly expressed in terms of the accessible variables rather than capturing
the necessary state in the member variables of a class with a function call operator.

 At its simplest, a lambda expression defines a self-contained function that takes no
parameters and relies only on global variables and functions. It doesn’t even have to
return a value. This lambda expression is a series of statements enclosed in brackets,
prefixed with square brackets (the lambda introducer):

```cpp
[]{
    do_stuff();
    do_more_stuff();
}();

Start the lambda
expression with [].

Finish the lambda,
and call it.
```

In this example, the lambda expression is called by following it with parentheses, but
this is unusual. For one thing, if you’re going to call it directly, you could usually do
away with the lambda and write the statements directly in the source. It’s more common to pass it as a parameter to a function template that takes a callable object as one
of its parameters, in which case it likely needs to take parameters or return a value or
both. If you need to take parameters, you can do this by following the lambda introducer  with  a  parameter  list  like  for  a  normal  function.  For  example,  the  following
code writes all the elements of the vector to std::cout separated by newlines:

```cpp
std::vector<int> data=make_data();
std::for_each(data.begin(),data.end(),[](int i){std::cout<<i<<"\n";});
```

Return  values  are  almost  as  easy.  If  your  lambda  function  body  consists  of  a  single
return statement, the return type of the lambda is the type of the expression being

returned. For example, you might use a simple lambda like this to wait for a flag to be
set with std::condition_variable (see section 4.1.1), as in the following listing.

Listing A.4 A simple lambda with a deduced return type

```cpp
std::condition_variable cond;
bool data_ready;
std::mutex m;
void wait_for_data()
{
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m);
    cond.wait(lk,[]{return data_ready;});
}
```

b

The return type of the lambda passed to cond.wait() B is deduced from the type of
data_ready and is thus bool. Whenever the condition variable wakes from waiting, it
then calls the lambda with the mutex locked and only returns from the call to wait()
once data_ready is true.

 What if you can’t write your lambda body as a single return statement? In that case
you have to specify the return type explicitly. You can do this even if your body is a single return statement, but you have to do it if your lambda body is more complex. The
return type is specified by following the lambda parameter list with an arrow (->) and
the return type. If your lambda doesn’t take any parameters, you must still include the
(empty) parameter list in order to specify the return value explicitly. Your condition
variable predicate can be written

```cpp
cond.wait(lk,[]()->bool{return data_ready;});
```

By specifying the return type, you can expand the lambda to log messages or do some
more complex processing:

```cpp
cond.wait(lk,[]()->bool{
    if(data_ready)
    {
        std::cout<<”Data ready”<<std::endl;
        return true;
    }
```

    else
```cpp
    {
        std::cout<<”Data not ready, resuming wait”<<std::endl;
        return false;
    }
});
```

Although simple lambdas like this are powerful and can simplify code quite a lot, the
real power of lambdas comes when they capture local variables.

Lambda functions

A.5.1 Lambda functions that reference local variables
Lambda  functions  with  a  lambda  introducer  of  []  can’t  reference  any  local  variables
from the containing scope; they can only use global variables and anything passed in
as a parameter. If you want to access a local variable, you need to capture it. The simplest way to do this is to capture the entire set of variables within the local scope by
using  a  lambda  introducer  of  [=].  That’s  all  there  is  to  it—your  lambda  can  now
access copies of the local variables at the time the lambda was created.
 To see this in action, consider the following simple function:

```cpp
std::function<int(int)> make_offseter(int offset)
{
   return [=](int j){return offset+j;};
}
```

Every  call  to  make_offseter  returns  a  new  lambda  function  object  through  the
```cpp
std::function<> function wrapper. This returned function adds the supplied offset
```

to any parameter supplied. For example,

```cpp
int main()
{
    std::function<int(int)> offset_42=make_offseter(42);
    std::function<int(int)> offset_123=make_offseter(123);
    std::cout<<offset_42(12)<<”,“<<offset_123(12)<<std::endl;
    std::cout<<offset_42(12)<<”,“<<offset_123(12)<<std::endl;
}
```

will write out 54,135 twice because the function returned from the first call to make_
offseter  always  adds  42  to  the  supplied  argument,  whereas  the  function  returned
from the second call to make_offseter always adds 123 to the supplied argument.

 This is the safest form of local variable capture; everything is copied, so you can
return the lambda and call it outside the scope of the original function. It’s not the
only choice though; you can choose to capture everything by reference instead. In this
case it’s undefined behavior to call the lambda once the variables it references have
been destroyed by exiting the function or block scope to which they belong, just as it’s
undefined  behavior  to  reference  a  variable  that  has  already  been  destroyed  in  any
other circumstance.

 A lambda function that captures all the local variables by reference is introduced

using [&], as in the following example:

B

```cpp
int main()
{
    int offset=42;
    std::function<int(int)> offset_a=[&](int j){return offset+j;};
    offset=123;
    std::function<int(int)> offset_b=[&](int j){return offset+j;};
    std::cout<<offset_a(12)<<”,”<<offset_b(12)<<std::endl;
    offset=99;
    std::cout<<offset_a(12)<<”,”<<offset_b(12)<<std::endl;
}
```

h

- g

e

Whereas in the make_offseter function from the previous example you used the [=]
lambda introducer to capture a copy of the offset, the offset_a function in this example uses the [&] lambda introducer to capture offset by reference c. It doesn’t matter  that  the  initial  value  of  offset  is  42 B;  the  result  of  calling  offset_a(12)  will
always  depend  on  the  current  value  of  offset.  Even  though  the  value  of  offset  is
then changed to 123 d, before you produce the second (identical) lambda function,
offset_b e, this second lambda again captures by reference, so the result depends
on the current value of offset.

 Now, when you print the first line of output f, offset is still 123, so the output is
135,135. But at the second line of output h, offset has been changed to 99 g, so
this time the output is 111,111. Both offset_a and offset_b add the current value of
offset (99) to the supplied argument (12).

  Now,  C++  being  C++,  you’re  not  stuck  with  these  all-or-nothing  options;  you
can choose to capture some variables by copy and some by reference, and you can
choose  to  capture  only  those  variables  you  have  explicitly  chosen  by  tweaking  the
lambda introducer. If you want to copy all the used variables except for one or two,
you can use the [=] form of the lambda introducer but follow the equals sign with a
list  of  variables  to  capture  by  reference  preceded  with  ampersands.  The  following
example will print 1239, because i is copied into the lambda, but j and k are captured by reference:

```cpp
int main()
{
    int i=1234,j=5678,k=9;
    std::function<int()> f=[=,&j,&k]{return i+j+k;};
    i=1;
    j=2;
    k=3;
    std::cout<<f()<<std::endl;
}
```

Alternatively, you can capture by reference by default but capture a specific subset of
variables by copying. In this case, you use the [&] form of the lambda introducer but
follow the ampersand with a list of variables to capture by copy. The following example prints 5688 because i is captured by reference, but j and k are copied:

```cpp
int main()
{
    int i=1234,j=5678,k=9;
    std::function<int()> f=[&,j,k]{return i+j+k;};
    i=1;
    j=2;
    k=3;
    std::cout<<f()<<std::endl;
}
```

If you only want to capture the named variables, then you can omit the leading = or &
and just list the variables to be captured, prefixing them with an ampersand to capture

Lambda functions

by reference rather than copy. The following code will print 5682 because i and k are
captured by reference, but j is copied:

```cpp
int main()
{
    int i=1234,j=5678,k=9;
    std::function<int()> f=[&i,j,&k]{return i+j+k;};
    i=1;
    j=2;
    k=3;
    std::cout<<f()<<std::endl;
}
```

This final variant allows you to ensure that only the intended variables are being captured, because any reference to a local variable not in the capture list will cause a compilation error. If you choose this option, you have to be careful when accessing class
members if the function containing the lambda is a member function. Class members
can’t be captured directly; if you want to access class members from your lambda, you
have  to  capture  the  this  pointer  by  adding  it  to  the  capture  list.  In  the  following
example, the lambda captures this to allow access to the some_data class member:

```cpp
struct X
{
    int some_data;
    void foo(std::vector<int>& vec)
    {
        std::for_each(vec.begin(),vec.end(),
            [this](int& i){i+=some_data;});
    }
```

};

In the context of concurrency, lambdas are most useful as predicates for std::condition
```cpp
_variable::wait()  (section  4.1.1)  and  with  std::packaged_task<>  (section  4.2.1)
```

or thread pools for packaging small tasks. They can also be passed to the std::thread
constructor as a thread function (section 2.1.1) and as the function when using parallel algorithms such as parallel_for_each() (from section 8.5.1).

  Since  C++14,  lambdas  can  also  be  generic  lamdas,  where  the  parameter  types  are
declared as auto rather than a specified type. In this case, the function call operator is
implicitly  a  template,  and  the  type  of  the  parameter  is  deduced  from  the  supplied
argument when the lambda is invoked; for example:

```cpp
auto f=[](auto x){ std::cout<<”x=”<<x<<std::endl;};
```

f(42); // x is of type int; outputs “x=42”
f(“hello”); // x is of type const char*; outputs “x=hello”

C++14 also adds the concept of generalized captures, so you can capture the results of
expressions, rather than a direct copy of or reference to a local variable. Most commonly this can be used to capture move-only types by moving them, rather than having to capture by reference; for example:

```cpp
std::future<int> spawn_async_task(){
    std::promise<int> p;
    auto f=p.get_future();
    std::thread t([p=std::move(p)](){ p.set_value(find_the_answer());});
    t.detach();
    return f;
}
```

Here, the promise is moved into the lambda by the p=std::move(p) generalized capture, so it is safe to detach the thread, without the worry of a dangling reference to a
local variable that has been destroyed. After the construction of the lambda, the original p is now in a moved-from state, which is why you had to get the future beforehand.

A.6

Variadic templates

Variadic templates are templates with a variable number of parameters. Just as you’ve
always been able to have variadic functions, such as printf, that take a variable number of parameters, you can now have variadic templates that have a variable number of
template parameters. Variadic templates are used throughout the C++ Thread Library.
For  example,  the  std::thread  constructor  for  starting  a  thread  (section  2.1.1)  is  a
```cpp
variadic  function  template,  and  std::packaged_task<>  (section  4.2.2)  is  a  variadic
```

class template. From a user’s point of view, it’s enough to know that the template takes
an  unbounded  number  of  parameters,  but  if  you  want  to  write  this  template,  or  if
you’re interested in how it all works, you need to know the details.

 Just as variadic functions are declared with an ellipsis (...) in the function parameter list, variadic templates are declared with an ellipsis in the template parameter list:

```cpp
template<typename ... ParameterPack>
class my_template
```

{};

You can use variadic templates for a partial specialization of a template too, even if the
primary template isn’t variadic. For example, the primary template for std::packaged
_task<> (section 4.2.1) is a simple template with a single template parameter:

```cpp
template<typename FunctionType>
class packaged_task;
```

But this primary template is never defined anywhere; it’s a placeholder for the partial
specialization:

```cpp
template<typename ReturnType,typename ... Args>
class packaged_task<ReturnType(Args...)>;
```

It’s this partial specialization that contains the real definition of the class; you saw in
declare a task that takes an std::string and a double as parameters when you call it
and that provides the result through an std::future<int>.

Variadic templates

  This  declaration  shows  two  additional  features  of  variadic  templates.  The  first
feature  is  relatively  simple:  you  can  have  normal  template  parameters  (such  as
ReturnType) as well as variadic ones (Args) in the same declaration. The second feature demonstrated is the use of Args... in the template argument list of the specialization to show that the types that make up Args when the template is instantiated
are  to  be  listed  here.  Because  this  is  a  partial  specialization,  it  works  as  a  pattern
match; the types that occur in this context in the instantiation are captured as Args.
The  variadic  parameter  Args  is  called  a  parameter  pack,  and  the  use  of  Args...  is
called a pack expansion.

  Like  with  variadic  functions,  the  variadic  part  may  be  an  empty  list  or  may  have
many entries. For example, with std::packaged_task<my_class()> the ReturnType
parameter  is  my_class,  and  the  Args  parameter  pack  is  empty,  whereas  with
```cpp
std::packaged_task<void(int,double,my_class&,std::string*)> the ReturnType
```

is void, and Args is the list int, double, my_class&, std::string*.

A.6.1 Expanding the parameter pack

The power of variadic templates comes from what you can do with that pack expansion: you aren’t limited to expanding the list of types as is. First off, you can use a pack
expansion directly anywhere a list of types is required, such as in the argument list for
another template:

```cpp
template<typename ... Params>
struct dummy
{
    std::tuple<Params...> data;
```

};

In  this  case  the  single  member  variable  data  is  an  instantiation  of  std::tuple<>
containing  all  the  types  specified,  so  dummy<int,double,char>  has  a  member  of
type std::tuple<int,double,char>.  You  can  combine  pack  expansions  with  normal types:

```cpp
template<typename ... Params>
struct dummy2
{
    std::tuple<std::string,Params...> data;
```

};

This time, the tuple has an additional (first) member of type std::string. The nifty
part is that you can create a pattern with the pack expansion, which is then copied for
each element in the expansion. You do this by putting the ... that marks the pack
expansion at the end of the pattern. For example, rather than just creating a tuple of
the elements supplied in your parameter pack, you can create a tuple of pointers to
the elements or even a tuple of std::unique_ptr<> to your elements:

```cpp
template<typename ... Params>
struct dummy3

{
    std::tuple<Params* ...> pointers;
    std::tuple<std::unique_ptr<Params> ...> unique_pointers;
```

};

The  type  expression  can  be  as  complex  as  you  like,  provided  the  parameter  pack
occurs in the type expression, and provided the expression is followed by the ... that
marks the expansion. When the parameter pack is expanded, for each entry in the pack
that type is substituted into the type expression to generate the corresponding entry in
the resulting list. If your parameter pack Params contains the types int,int,char, then
the expansion of std::tuple<std::pair<std::unique_ptr<Params>,double> ... > is
```cpp
std::tuple<std::pair<std::unique_ptr<int>,double>,  std::pair<std::unique_
```

ptr<int>,double>, std::pair<std::unique_ptr<char>,double> >. If the pack expansion is used as a template argument list, that template doesn’t have to have variadic
parameters, but if it doesn’t, the size of the pack must exactly match the number of
template parameters required:

```cpp
template<typename ... Types>
struct dummy4
{
    std::pair<Types...> data;
```

};
```cpp
dummy4<int,char> a;
dummy4<int> b;
dummy4<int,int,int> c;
```

OK, data is
```cpp
std::pair<int,char>.
```

Error; no second type.

Error; too many types.

The second thing you can do with a pack expansion is use it to declare a list of function parameters:

```cpp
template<typename ... Args>
void foo(Args ... args);
```

This  creates  a  new  parameter  pack,  args,  which  is  a  list  of  the  function  parameters
rather than a list of types, which you can expand with ... as before. Now, you can use
a pattern with the pack expansion for declaring the function parameters, just as you
can use a pattern when you expand the pack elsewhere. For example, this is used by
the std::thread constructor to take all the function arguments by rvalue reference
(see section A.1):

```cpp
template<typename CallableType,typename ... Args>
thread::thread(CallableType&& func,Args&& ... args);
```

The function parameter pack can then be used to call another function, by specifying
the pack expansion in the argument list of the called function. As with the type expansions,  you  can  use  a  pattern  for  each  expression  in  the  resulting  argument  list.  For
example, one common idiom with rvalue references is to use std::forward<> to preserve the rvalue-ness of the supplied function arguments:

Automatically deducing the type of a variable

```cpp
template<typename ... ArgTypes>
void bar(ArgTypes&& ... args)
{
    foo(std::forward<ArgTypes>(args)...);
}
```

Note that in this case, the pack expansion contains both the type pack ArgTypes and
the function parameter pack args, and the ellipsis follows the whole expression. If you
call bar like this,

```cpp
int i;
bar(i,3.141,std::string("hello "));

then the expansion becomes

template<>
void bar<int&,double,std::string>(
    int& args_1,
    double&& args_2,
    std::string&& args_3)
{
    foo(std::forward<int&>(args_1),
        std::forward<double>(args_2),
        std::forward<std::string>(args_3));
}
```

which correctly passes the first argument on to foo as an lvalue reference, while passing the others as rvalue references.

 The final thing you can do with a parameter pack is find its size with the sizeof...
operator. This is quite simple: sizeof...(p) is the number of elements in the parameter pack p. It doesn’t matter whether this is a type parameter pack or a function argument parameter pack; the result is the same. This is probably the only case where you
can use a parameter pack and not follow it with an ellipsis; the ellipsis is already part
of the sizeof... operator. The following function returns the number of arguments
supplied to it:

```cpp
template<typename ... Args>
unsigned count_args(Args ... args)
{
    return sizeof... (Args);
}
```

As with the normal sizeof operator, the result of sizeof... is a constant expression,
so it can be used for specifying array bounds and so forth.

A.7

Automatically deducing the type of a variable

C++ is a statically typed language: the type of every variable is known at compile time.
Not only that, but as a programmer you have to specify the type of each variable. In
some cases this can lead to quite unwieldy names; for example:

```cpp
std::map<std::string,std::unique_ptr<some_data>> m;
std::map<std::string,std::unique_ptr<some_data>>::iterator
    iter=m.find("my key");
```

Traditionally,  the  solution  has  been  to  use  typedefs  to  reduce  the  length  of  a  type
identifier  and  potentially  eliminate  problems  due  to  inconsistent  types.  This  still
works in C++11, but there’s now a new way: if a variable is initialized in its declaration
from a value of the same type, then you can specify the type as auto. In this case, the
compiler will automatically deduce the type of the variable to be the same as the initializer. The iterator example can be written as

```cpp
auto iter=m.find("my key");
```

Now, you’re not restricted to plain auto; you can embellish it to declare const variables or pointer or reference variables too. Here are a few variable declarations using
auto and the corresponding type of the variable:

```cpp
auto i=42;        // int
```

auto& j=i;        // int&
```cpp
auto const k=i;   // int const
```

auto* const p=&i; // int * const

The  rules  for  deducing  the  type  of  the  variable  are  based  on  the  rules  for  the  only
other  place  in  the  language  where  types  are  deduced:  parameters  of  function  templates. In a declaration of the form

```cpp
some-type-expression-involving-auto var=some-expression;
```

the type of var is the same as the type deduced for the parameter of a function template declared with the same type expression, except replacing auto with the name of
a template type parameter:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void f(type-expression var);
f(some-expression);
```

This means that array types decay to pointers, and references are dropped unless the
type expression explicitly declares the variable as a reference; for example:

```cpp
int some_array[45];
auto p=some_array;   // int*
int& r=*p;
auto x=r;            // int
```

auto& y=r;           // int&

This can greatly simplify the declaration of variables, particularly where the full type
identifier is long or possibly not even known (for example, the type of the result of a
function call in a template).

Thread-local variables

A.8

Thread-local variables

Thread-local variables allow you to have a separate instance of a variable for each thread
in  your  program.  You  mark  a  variable  as  being  thread-local  by  declaring  it  with  the
thread_local keyword. Variables at namespace scope, static data members of classes,
and local variables can be declared thread-local, and are said to have thread storage
duration:

A thread-local variable
at namespace scope

```cpp
thread_local int x;
class X
{
    static thread_local std::string s;
```

};
```cpp
static thread_local std::string X::s;
void foo()
{
    thread_local std::vector<int> v;
}

A thread-local static
class data member
```

The definition of X::s is
required.

A thread-local
local variable

Thread-local variables at namespace scope and thread-local static class data members
are constructed before the first use of a thread-local variable from the same translation unit, but it isn’t specified how much before. Some implementations may construct
thread-local variables when the thread is started; others may construct them immediately  before  their  first  use  on  each  thread,  and  others  may  construct  them  at  other
times, or in some combination depending on their usage context. Indeed, if none of
the thread-local variables from a given translation unit is used, there’s no guarantee
that  they  will  be  constructed  at  all.  This  allows  for  the  dynamic  loading  of  modules
containing  thread-local  variables—these  variables  can  be  constructed  on  a  given
thread the first time that thread references a thread-local variable from the dynamically-loaded module.

 Thread-local variables declared inside a function are initialized the first time the
flow of control passes through their declaration on a given thread. If the function is
not called by a given thread, any thread-local variables declared in that function are
not  constructed.  This  is  the  same  as  the  behavior  for  local  static  variables,  except  it
applies separately to each thread.

 Thread-local variables share other properties with static variables—they’re zeroinitialized prior to any further initialization (such as dynamic initialization), and if the
construction of a thread-local variable throws an exception, std::terminate() is called
to abort the application.

 The destructors for all thread-local variables that have been constructed on a given
thread are run when the thread function returns, in the reverse order of construction.
Because the order of initialization is unspecified, it’s important to ensure that there
are no interdependencies between the destructors of these variables. If the destructor
of a thread-local variable exits with an exception, std::terminate() is called, as for
construction.

A.9

  Thread-local  variables  are  also  destroyed  for  a  thread  if  that  thread  calls
std::exit() or returns from main() (which is equivalent to calling std::exit() with
the return value of main()). If any other threads are still running when the application exits, the destructors of thread-local variables on those threads are not called.

  Though  thread-local  variables  have  a  different  address  on  each  thread,  you  can
still obtain a normal pointer to this variable. The pointer then references the object in
the thread that took the address, and can be used to allow other threads to access that
object. It’s undefined behavior to access an object after it’s been destroyed (as always),
so  if  you  pass  a  pointer  to  a  thread-local  variable  to  another  thread,  you  need  to
ensure it’s not dereferenced once the owning thread has finished.

Class Template Argument Deduction
C++17 extends the idea of automatically deducing types to template parameters: if you
are declaring an object of a templated type, then in many cases the type of the template parameters can be deduced from the object initializer.

 Specifically, if an object is declared with the name of a class template, without specifying a template argument list, then constructors specified in the class template are
used to deduce the template arguments from the object's initializer, as per the normal
type deduction rules for function templates.

  For  example,  std::lock_guard  takes  a  single  template  parameter,  which  is  the
type of the mutex. The constructor also takes a single parameter, which is a reference
to  that  type.  If  you  declare  an  object  to  be  of  type  std::lock_guard,  then  the  type
parameter can be deduced from the type of the supplied mutex:

```cpp
std::mutex m;
std::lock_guard guard(m); // deduces std::lock_guard<std::mutex>
```

The same applies to std::scoped_lock, except that it has multiple template parameters, which can be deduced from multiple mutex arguments:

```cpp
std::mutex m1;
std::shared_mutex m2;
std::scoped_lock guard(m1,m2);
// deduces std::scoped_lock<std::mutex,std::shared_mutex>
```

For  those  templates  where  the  constructors  would  lead  to  the  wrong  types  being
deduced, the template author can write explicit deduction guides to ensure the correct types are deduced. But these are beyond the scope of this book.

### Summary

This appendix has only scratched the surface of the new language features introduced
with  the  C++11  Standard,  because  we’ve  only  looked  at  those  features  that  actively
affect  the  usage  of  the  Thread  Library.  Other  new  language  features  include  static
assertions,  strongly  typed  enumerations,  delegating  constructors,  Unicode  support,
template  aliases,  and  a  new  uniform  initialization  sequence,  along  with  a  host  of

### Summary

smaller changes. Describing all the new features in detail is outside the scope of this
book; it would probably require a book in itself. There are also a considerable number
of changes added with C++14 and C++17, but again these are outside the scope of this
book. The best overview of the entire set of changes to the standard at the time of writing  is  probably  the  documentation  at  cppreference.com,1  as  well  as  Bjarne  Stroustrup’s C++11 FAQ,2 though popular C++ reference books will be revised to cover it in
due course.

 Hopefully the brief introduction to the new features covered in this appendix has
provided enough depth to show how they relate to the Thread Library and to enable
you  to  write  and  understand  multithreaded  code  that  uses  these  new  features.
Although this appendix should provide enough depth for simple uses of the features
covered, this is still only a brief introduction and not a complete reference or tutorial
for the use of these features. If you intend to make extensive use of them, I recommend acquiring a reference or tutorial in order to gain the most benefit from them.
