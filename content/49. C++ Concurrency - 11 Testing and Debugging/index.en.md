# Chapter 11: Testing and debugging multithreaded applications

Testing and debugging
multithreaded applications

This chapter covers

- Concurrency-related bugs
- Locating bugs through testing and code review
- Designing multithreaded tests
- Testing the performance of multithreaded code

Up to now, I’ve focused on what’s involved in writing concurrent code—the tools that
are available, how to use them, and the overall design and structure of the code. But
there’s  a  crucial  part  of  software  development  that  I  haven’t  addressed  yet:  testing
and debugging. If you’re reading this chapter hoping for an easy way to test concurrent code, you’re going to be sorely disappointed. Testing and debugging concurrent
code is hard. What I am going to give you are some techniques that will make things
easier, alongside some issues that are important to think about.

 Testing and debugging are like two sides of a coin—you subject your code to
tests  in  order  to  find  any  bugs  that  might  be  there,  and  you  debug  it  to  remove
those bugs. With any luck, you only have to remove the bugs found by your own
tests rather than bugs found by the end users of your application. Before we look at
either testing or debugging, it’s important to understand the problems that might
arise, so let’s look at those.

## 11.1 Types of concurrency-related bugs

You  can  get  any  sort  of  bug  in  concurrent  code;  it’s  not  special  in  that  regard.  But
some types of bugs are directly related to the use of concurrency and therefore of particular relevance to this book. Typically, these concurrency-related bugs fall into two
categories:

- Unwanted blocking
- Race conditions

These are broad categories, so let’s divide them up a bit. First, let’s look at unwanted
blocking.

### 11.1.1 Unwanted blocking

What do I mean by unwanted blocking? A thread is blocked when it’s unable to proceed
because it’s waiting for something. This is typically something like a mutex, a condition variable, or a future, but it could be waiting for I/O. This is a natural part of
multithreaded  code,  but  it’s  not  always  desirable—hence  the  problem  of  unwanted
blocking. This leads us to the next question: why is this blocking unwanted? Typically, this is because some other thread is also waiting for the blocked thread to perform some action, and so that thread in turn is blocked. There are several variations
on this theme:

- Deadlock—As you saw in chapter 3, in the case of deadlock, one thread is waiting
for another, which is in turn waiting for the first. If your threads deadlock, the
tasks they’re supposed to be doing won’t get done. In the most visible cases, one
of the threads involved is the thread responsible for the user interface, in which
case the interface will cease to respond. In other cases, the interface will remain
responsive,  but  some  required  tasks  won’t  complete,  such  as  a  search  not
returning or a document not printing.

- Livelock—Livelock  is  similar  to  deadlock  in  that  one  thread  is  waiting  for
another, which is in turn waiting for the first. The key difference here is that the
wait is not a blocking wait but an active checking loop, such as a spin lock. In
serious  cases,  the  symptoms  are  the  same  as  deadlock  (the  app  doesn’t  make
any progress), except that the CPU usage is high because threads are still running but blocking each other. In not-so-serious cases, the livelock will eventually
resolve because of the random scheduling, but there will be a long delay in the
task that got livelocked, with a high CPU usage during that delay.

- Blocking on I/O or other external input—If your thread is blocked waiting for external input, it can’t proceed, even if the waited-for input is never going to come.
It’s  therefore  undesirable  to  block  on  external  input  from  a  thread  that  also
performs tasks that other threads may be waiting for.

That briefly covers unwanted blocking. What about race conditions?

Types of concurrency-related bugs

### 11.1.2 Race conditions

Race  conditions  are  the  most  common  cause  of  problems  in  multithreaded  code—
many deadlocks and livelocks only manifest because of a race condition. Not all race
conditions are problematic—a race condition occurs any time the behavior depends
on the relative scheduling of operations in separate threads. A large number of race
conditions are entirely benign; for example, which worker thread processes the next
task in the task queue is largely irrelevant. But many concurrency bugs are due to race
conditions. In particular, race conditions often cause the following types of problems:

- Data  races—A  data  race  is  the  specific  type  of  race  condition  that  results  in
undefined behavior because of unsynchronized concurrent access to a shared
memory location. I introduced data races in chapter 5 when we looked at the
C++ memory model. Data races usually occur through incorrect usage of atomic
operations  to  synchronize  threads  or  through  access  to  shared  data  without
locking the appropriate mutex.

- Broken  invariants—These  can  manifest  as  dangling  pointers  (because  another
thread deleted the data being accessed), random memory corruption (due to a
thread reading inconsistent values resulting from partial updates), and doublefree (such as when two threads pop the same value from a queue, and so both
delete some associated data), among others. The invariants being broken can
be temporal- as well as value-based. If operations on separate threads are required
to  execute  in  a  particular  order,  incorrect  synchronization  can  lead  to  a  race
condition in which the required order is sometimes violated.

- Lifetime  issues—Although  you  could  bundle  these  problems  in  with  broken
invariants, this is a separate category. The basic problem with bugs in this category is that the thread outlives the data that it accesses, so it is accessing data
that  has  been  deleted  or  otherwise  destroyed,  and  potentially  the  storage  is
even reused for another object. You typically get lifetime issues where a thread
references local variables that go out of scope before the thread function has
completed,  but  they  aren’t  limited  to  that  scenario.  Whenever  the  lifetime  of
the thread and the data it operates on aren’t tied together in some way, there’s
the potential for the data to be destroyed before the thread has finished and for
the thread function to have the rug pulled out from under its feet. If you manually call join() in order to wait for the thread to complete, you need to ensure
that the call to join() can’t be skipped if an exception is thrown. This is basic
exception safety applied to threads.

It’s the problematic race conditions that are the killers. With deadlock and livelock,
the  application  appears  to  hang  and  become  completely  unresponsive  or  takes  too
long to complete a task. Often, you can attach a debugger to the running process to
identify which threads are involved in the deadlock or livelock and which synchronization  objects  they’re  fighting  over.  With  data  races,  broken  invariants,  and  lifetime
issues,  the  visible  symptoms  of  the  problem  (such  as  random  crashes  or  incorrect

output) can manifest anywhere in the code—the code may overwrite memory used by
another part of the system that isn’t touched until much later. The fault will then manifest in code completely unrelated to the location of the buggy code, possibly much
later  in  the  execution  of  the  program.  This  is  the  true  curse  of  shared  memory  systems—however much you try to limit which data is accessible by which thread, and try
to  ensure  that  correct  synchronization  is  used,  any  thread  can  overwrite  the  data
being used by any other thread in the application.

 Now that we’ve briefly identified the sorts of problems we’re looking for, let’s look

at what you can do to locate any instances in your code so you can fix them.

## 11.2 Techniques for locating concurrency-related bugs

In the previous section we looked at the types of concurrency-related bugs you might
see and how they might manifest in your code. With that information in mind, you
can then look at your code to see where bugs might lie and how you can attempt to
determine whether there are any bugs in a particular section.

  Perhaps  the  most  obvious  and  straightforward  thing  to  do  is  look  at  the  code.
Although this might seem obvious, it’s difficult to do in a thorough way. When you
read  code  you’ve  written,  it’s  all  too  easy  to  read  what  you  intended  to  write  rather
than what’s there. Likewise, when reviewing code that others have written, it’s tempting to give it a quick read-through, check it off against your local coding standards,
and  highlight  any  glaringly  obvious  problems.  What’s  needed  is  to  spend  the  time
going  through  the  code  with  a  fine-tooth  comb,  thinking  about  the  concurrency
issues—and the nonconcurrency issues as well. (You might as well, while you’re doing
it. After all, a bug is a bug.) We’ll cover specific things to think about when reviewing
code shortly.

 Even after thoroughly reviewing your code, you still might have missed some bugs,
and in any case, you need to confirm that it does work, for peace of mind if nothing
else. Consequently, we’ll continue on from reviewing the code to a few techniques to
employ when testing multithreaded code.

### 11.2.1 Reviewing code to locate potential bugs

As I’ve already mentioned, when reviewing multithreaded code to check for concurrencyrelated bugs, it’s important to review it thoroughly. If possible, get someone else to
review it. Because they haven’t written the code, they’ll have to think through how it
works, and this will help to uncover any bugs that may be there. It’s important that the
reviewer  have  the  time  to  do  the  review  properly—not  a  casual  two-minute  quick
glance, but a proper, considered review. Most concurrency bugs require more than a
quick glance to spot—they usually rely on subtle timing issues to manifest.

 If you get one of your colleagues to review the code, they’ll be coming at it fresh.
They’ll therefore see things from a different point of view and may spot things that
you can’t. If you don’t have colleagues you can ask, ask a friend, or even post the
code on the internet (taking care not to upset your company lawyers). If you can’t

Techniques for locating concurrency-related bugs

get anybody to review your code for you, or they don’t find anything, don’t worry—
there’s still more you can do. For starters, it might be worth leaving the code alone
for a while—work on another part of the application, read a book, or go for a walk.
If you take a break, your subconscious can work on the problem in the background
while you’re consciously focused on something else. Also, the code will be less familiar when you come back to it—you might manage to look at it from a different perspective yourself.

 An alternative to getting someone else to review your code is to do it yourself. One
useful technique is to try to explain how it works in detail to someone else. They don’t
even have to be physically there—many teams have a bear or rubber chicken for this
purpose, and I personally find that writing detailed notes can be hugely beneficial. As
you explain, think about each line, what could happen, which data it accesses, and so
forth. Ask yourself questions about the code, and explain the answers. I find this to be
an  incredibly  powerful  technique—by  asking  myself  these  questions  and  thinking
carefully about the answers, the problem often reveals itself. These questions can be
helpful for any code review, not just when reviewing your own code.

QUESTIONS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN REVIEWING MULTITHREADED CODE
As I’ve already mentioned, it can be useful for a reviewer (whether the code’s author
or  someone  else)  to  think  about  specific  questions  relating  to  the  code  being
reviewed. These questions can focus the reviewer’s mind on the relevant details of the
code and can help identify potential problems. The questions I like to ask include the
following, though this is most definitely not an exhaustive list. You might find other
questions that help you to focus better. Here are my questions:

- Which data needs to be protected from concurrent access?
- How do you ensure that the data is protected?
- Where in the code could other threads be at this time?
- Which mutexes does this thread hold?
- Which mutexes might other threads hold?
- Are  there  any  ordering  requirements  between  the  operations  done  in  this
thread and those done in another? How are those requirements enforced?
- Is  the  data  loaded  by  this  thread  still  valid?  Could  it  have  been  modified  by

other threads?

- If you assume that another thread could be modifying the data, what would that

mean and how could you ensure that this never happens?

This  last  question  is  my  favorite,  because  it  makes  me  think  about  the  relationships
between the threads. By assuming the existence of a bug related to a particular line of
code, you can then act as a detective and track down the cause. In order to convince
yourself  that  there’s  no  bug,  you  have  to  consider  every  corner  case  and  possible
ordering.  This  is  particularly  useful  where  the  data  is  protected  by  more  than  one
mutex over its lifetime, such as with the thread-safe queue from chapter 6 where you
had separate mutexes for the head and tail of the queue: in order to be sure that an

access is safe while holding one mutex, you have to be certain that a thread holding
the other mutex can’t also access the same element. It also makes it obvious that public
data, or data for which other code can readily obtain a pointer or reference, has to
come under particular scrutiny.

 The penultimate question in the list is also important, because it addresses a mistake that is easy to make: if you release and then reacquire a mutex, you must assume
that other threads may have modified the shared data. Although this is obvious, if the
mutex  locks  aren’t  immediately  visible—perhaps  because  they’re  internal  to  an
object—you may unwittingly be doing exactly that. In chapter 6 you saw how this can
lead to race conditions and bugs where the functions provided on a thread-safe data
structure are too fine-grained. Whereas for a non-thread-safe stack it makes sense to
have separate top() and pop() operations, for a stack that may be accessed by multiple threads concurrently, this is no longer the case because the lock on the internal
mutex is released between the two calls, and so another thread can modify the stack.
As you saw in chapter 6, the solution is to combine the two operations so they are both
performed  under  the  protection  of  the  same  mutex  lock,  eliminating  the  potential
race condition.

 OK, so you’ve reviewed your code (or got someone else to review it). You’re sure
there are no bugs. The proof of the pudding is, as they say, in the eating—how can
you test your code to confirm or disprove your belief in its lack of bugs?

### 11.2.2 Locating concurrency-related bugs by testing

When  developing  single-threaded  applications,  testing  your  applications  is  relatively
straightforward,  if  time-consuming.  You  could,  in  principle,  identify  all  the  possible
sets  of  input  data  (or  at  least  all  the  interesting  cases)  and  run  them  through  the
application. If the application produced the correct behavior and output, you’d know
it works for that given set of input. Testing for error states such as the handling of diskfull errors is more complicated than that, but the idea is the same: set up the initial
conditions and allow the application to run.

 Testing multithreaded code is an order of magnitude harder, because the precise
scheduling  of  the  threads  is  indeterminate  and  may  vary  from  run  to  run.  Consequently, even if you run the application with the same input data, it might work correctly some of the time, and fail at other times if there’s a race condition lurking in
the code. Having a potential race condition doesn’t mean the code will fail always, just
that it might fail sometimes.

 Given the inherent difficulty of reproducing concurrency-related bugs, it pays to
design your tests carefully. You want each test to run the smallest amount of code that
could potentially demonstrate a problem, so that you can best isolate the code that’s
faulty if the test fails—it’s better to test a concurrent queue directly to verify that concurrent pushes and pops work rather than testing it through a whole chunk of code
that uses the queue. It can help if you think about how code should be tested when
designing it—see the section on designing for testability later in this chapter.

Techniques for locating concurrency-related bugs

 It’s also worth eliminating the concurrency from the test in order to verify that the
problem is concurrency-related. If you have a problem when everything is running in
a  single  thread,  it’s  a  common,  or  garden-variety,  bug  rather  than  a  concurrencyrelated bug. This is particularly important when trying to track down a bug that occurs
“in  the  wild”  as  opposed  to  being  detected  in  your  test  harness.  Just  because  a  bug
occurs in the multithreaded portion of your application doesn’t mean it’s automatically concurrency-related. If you’re using thread pools to manage the level of concurrency, there’s usually a configuration parameter you can set to specify the number of
worker threads. If you’re managing threads manually, you’ll have to modify the code
to use a single thread for the test. Either way, if you can reduce your application to a
single thread, you can eliminate concurrency as a cause. On the flip side, if the problem goes away on a single-core system (even with multiple threads running) but is present  on  multicore  systems  or  multiprocessor  systems,  you  have  a  race  condition  and
possibly a synchronization or memory-ordering issue.

  There’s  more  to  testing  concurrent  code  than  the  structure  of  the  code  being
tested; the structure of the test is just as important, as is the test environment. If you
continue on with the example of testing a concurrent queue, you have to think about
various scenarios:

- One thread calling push() or pop() on its own to verify that the queue works at

a basic level

- One thread calling push() on an empty queue while another thread calls pop()
- Multiple threads calling push() on an empty queue
- Multiple threads calling push() on a full queue
- Multiple threads calling pop() on an empty queue
- Multiple threads calling pop() on a full queue
- Multiple threads calling pop() on a partially full queue with insufficient items

for all threads

- Multiple threads calling push() while one thread calls pop() on an empty queue
- Multiple threads calling push() while one thread calls pop() on a full queue
- Multiple threads calling push() while multiple threads call pop() on an empty

queue

- Multiple threads calling push() while multiple threads call pop() on a full queue

Having thought about all these scenarios and more, you then need to consider additional factors about the test environment:

- What you mean by “multiple threads” in each case (3, 4, 1,024?)
- Whether  there  are  enough  processing  cores  in  the  system  for  each  thread  to

run on its own core

- Which processor architectures the tests should be run on
- How you ensure suitable scheduling for the “while” parts of your tests

There  are  additional  factors  to  think  about  specific  to  your  particular  situation.  Of
these four environmental considerations, the first and last affect the structure of the
test itself (and are covered in section 11.2.5), whereas the other two are related to the
physical test system being used. The number of threads to use relates to the particular
code  being  tested,  but  there  are  various  ways  of  structuring  tests  to  obtain  suitable
scheduling. Before we look at these techniques, let’s look at how you can design your
application code to be easier to test.

### 11.2.3 Designing for testability

Testing multithreaded code is difficult, so you want to do what you can to make it easier. One of the most important things you can do is design the code for testability. A lot
has been written about designing single-threaded code for testability, and much of the
advice still applies. In general, code is easier to test if the following factors apply:

- The responsibilities of each function and class are clear
- The functions are short and to the point
- Your tests can take complete control of the environment surrounding the code

being tested

- The code that performs the particular operation being tested is close together

rather than spread throughout the system

- You thought about how to test the code before you wrote it

All of these are still true for multithreaded code. In fact, I’d argue that it’s even more
important  to  pay  attention  to  the  testability  of  multithreaded  code  than  for  singlethreaded  code,  because  it’s  inherently  that  much  harder  to  test.  That  last  point  is
important: even if you don’t go as far as writing your tests before the code, it’s well
worth thinking about how you can test the code before you write it—what inputs to
use, which conditions are likely to be problematic, how to stimulate the code in potentially problematic ways, and so on.

 One of the best ways to design concurrent code for testing is to eliminate the concurrency. If you can break down the code into those parts that are responsible for the
communication paths between threads and those parts that operate on the communicated  data  within  a  single  thread,  then  you’ve  greatly  reduced  the  problem.  Those
parts of the application that operate on data that’s being accessed by only that one
thread can then be tested using the normal single-threaded techniques. The hard-totest  concurrent  code  that  deals  with  communicating  between  threads  and  ensuring
that  only  one  thread  at  a  time  is  accessing  a  particular  block  of  data  is  now  much
smaller and the testing more tractable.

 For example, if your application is designed as a multithreaded state machine, you
could split it into several parts. The state logic for each thread, which ensures that the
transitions  and  operations  are  correct  for  each  possible  set  of  input  events,  can  be
tested independently with single-threaded techniques, with the test harness providing
the  input  events  that  would  be  coming  from  other  threads.  Then,  the  core  state

Techniques for locating concurrency-related bugs

machine and message routing code that ensures that events are correctly delivered to
the right thread in the right order can be tested independently, but with multiple concurrent threads and simple state logic designed specifically for the tests.

  Alternatively,  if  you  can  divide  your  code  into  multiple  blocks  of  read  shared
data/transform data/update shared data, you can test the transform data portions using
all  the  usual  single-threaded  techniques,  because  this  is  now  single-threaded  code.
The hard problem of testing a multithreaded transformation will be reduced to testing the reading and updating of the shared data, which is much simpler.

 One thing to watch out for is that library calls can use internal variables to store state,
which then becomes shared if multiple threads use the same set of library calls. This can
be a problem because it’s not immediately apparent that the code accesses shared data.
But with time you learn which library calls these are, and they stick out like sore thumbs.
You can then either add appropriate protection and synchronization or use an alternate
function that’s safe for concurrent access from multiple threads.

 There’s more to designing multithreaded code for testability than structuring your
code  to  minimize  the  amount  of  code  that  needs  to  deal  with  concurrency-related
issues and paying attention to the use of non-thread-safe library calls. It’s also helpful
to bear in mind the same set of questions you ask yourself when reviewing the code,
from  section  11.2.1.  Although  these  questions  aren’t  directly  about  testing  and  testability, if you think about the issues with your “testing hat” on and consider how to test
the code, it will affect which design choices you make and will make testing easier.

 Now that we’ve looked at designing code to make testing easier, and potentially
modified the code to separate the “concurrent” parts (such as the thread-safe containers  or  state  machine  event  logic)  from  the  “single-threaded”  parts  (which  may  still
interact  with  other  threads  through  the  concurrent  chunks),  let’s  look  at  the  techniques for testing concurrency-aware code.

### 11.2.4 Multithreaded testing techniques

So, you’ve thought through the scenario you want to test and written a small amount
of code that exercises the functions being tested. How do you ensure that any potentially problematic scheduling sequences are exercised in order to flush out the bugs?
 Well, there are a few ways of approaching this, starting with brute-force testing, or

stress testing.

BRUTE-FORCE TESTING
The idea behind brute-force testing is to stress the code to see if it breaks. This typically  means  running  the  code  many  times,  possibly  with  many  threads  running  at
once. If there’s a bug that manifests only when the threads are scheduled in a particular fashion, then the more times the code is run, the more likely the bug is to appear.
If you run the test once and it passes, you might feel a bit of confidence that the code
works. If you run it ten times in a row and it passes every time, you’ll likely feel more
confident. If you run the test a billion times and it passes every time, you’ll feel more
confident still.

 The confidence you have in the results does depend on the amount of code being
tested  by  each  test.  If  your  tests  are  quite  fine-grained,  like  the  tests  outlined  previously for a thread-safe queue, this brute-force testing can give you a high degree of
confidence in your code. On the other hand, if the code being tested is considerably
larger, the number of possible scheduling permutations is so vast that even a billion
test runs might yield a low level of confidence.

 The downside to brute-force testing is that it might give you false confidence. If the
way you’ve written the test means that the problematic circumstances can’t occur, you
can run the test as many times as you like and it won’t fail, even if it would fail every
time in slightly different circumstances. The worst example is where the problematic
circumstances can’t occur on your test system because of the way the particular system
you’re testing on happens to run. Unless your code is to run only on systems identical
to the one being tested, the particular hardware and operating system combination
may not allow the circumstances that would cause a problem to arise.

 The classic example here is testing a multithreaded application on a single-processor
system. Because every thread has to run on the same processor, everything is automatically  serialized,  and  many  race  conditions  and  cache  ping-pong  problems  that
you may get with a true multiprocessor system evaporate. This isn’t the only variable,
though;  different  processor  architectures  provide  different  synchronization  and
ordering facilities. For example, on x86 and x86-64 architectures, atomic load operations  are  always  the  same,  whether  tagged  memory_order_relaxed  or  memory_order
_seq_cst  (see  section  5.3.3).  This  means  that  code  written  using  relaxed  memory
ordering may work on systems with an x86 architecture, where it would fail on a system with a finer-grained set of memory-ordering instructions, such as SPARC.

 If you need your application to be portable across a range of target systems, it’s
important to test it on representative instances of those systems. This is why I listed the
processor architectures being used for testing as a consideration in section 11.2.2.

 Avoiding the potential for false confidence is crucial to successful brute-force testing. This requires careful thought over test design, not just with respect to the choice
of unit for the code being tested but also with respect to the design of the test harness
and the choice of testing environment. You need to ensure that you test as many of
the code paths and the possible thread interactions as feasible. Not only that, but you
need to know which options are covered and which are left untested.

  Although  brute-force  testing  does  give  you  some  degree  of  confidence  in  your
code, it’s not guaranteed to find all the problems. There’s one technique that is guaranteed  to  find  the  problems,  if  you  have  the  time  to  apply  it  to  your  code  and  the
appropriate software. I call it combination simulation testing.

COMBINATION SIMULATION TESTING
That’s a bit of a mouthful, so I’ll explain what I mean. The idea is that you run your
code with a special piece of software that simulates the real runtime environment of
the code. You may be aware of software that allows you to run multiple virtual machines
on a single physical computer, where the characteristics of the virtual machine and its

Techniques for locating concurrency-related bugs

hardware  are  emulated  by  the  supervisor  software.  The  idea  here  is  similar,  except
rather  than  emulating  the  system,  the  simulation  software  records  the  sequences  of
data accesses, locks, and atomic operations from each thread. It then uses the rules of
the C++ memory model to repeat the run with every permitted combination of operations and identify race conditions and deadlocks.

 Although this exhaustive combination testing is guaranteed to find all the problems the system is designed to detect, for anything but the most trivial of programs it
will  take  a  huge  amount  of  time,  because  the  number  of  combinations  increases
exponentially with the number of threads and the number of operations performed
by  each  thread.  This  technique  is  best  reserved  for  fine-grained  tests  of  individual
pieces of code rather than an entire application. The other obvious downside is that
it relies on the availability of simulation software that can handle the operations used
in your code.

 So, you have a technique that involves running your test many times under normal
conditions but that might miss problems, and you have a technique that involves running your test many times under special conditions but that’s more likely to find any
problems that exist. Are there any other options?

 A third option is to use a library that detects problems as they occur in the running

of the tests.

DETECTING PROBLEMS EXPOSED BY TESTS WITH A SPECIAL LIBRARY
Although this option doesn’t provide the exhaustive checking of a combination simulation test, you can identify many problems by using a special implementation of the
library synchronization primitives such as mutexes, locks, and condition variables. For
example, it’s common to require that all accesses to a piece of shared data be done
with a particular mutex locked. If you could check which mutexes were locked when
the data was accessed, you could verify that the appropriate mutex was indeed locked
by the calling thread when the data was accessed and report a failure if this was not
the case. By marking your shared data in some way, you can allow the library to check
this for you.

  This  library  implementation  can  also  record  the  sequence  of  locks  if  more  than
one  mutex  is  held  by  a  particular  thread  at  once.  If  another  thread  locks  the  same
mutexes in a different order, this could be recorded as a potential deadlock even if the
test didn’t deadlock while running.

  Another  type  of  special  library  that  could  be  used  when  testing  multithreaded
code is one where the implementations of the threading primitives such as mutexes
and  condition  variables  give  the  test  writer  control  over  which  thread  gets  the  lock
when multiple threads are waiting or which thread is notified by a notify_one() call
on a condition variable. This would allow you to set up particular scenarios and verify
that your code works as expected in those scenarios.

 Some of these testing facilities would have to be supplied as part of the C++ Standard  Library  implementation,  whereas  others  can  be  built  on  top  of  the  Standard
Library as part of your test harness.

  Having  looked  at  various  ways  of  executing  test  code,  let’s  now  look  at  ways  of

structuring the code to achieve the scheduling you want.

### 11.2.5 Structuring multithreaded test code

Back in section 11.2.2, I said that you need to find ways of providing suitable scheduling
for the “while” part of your tests. Now it’s time to look at the issues involved in that.

 The basic issue is that you need to arrange for a set of threads to each be executing
a chosen piece of code at a time that you specify. In the most basic case you have two
threads, but this could easily be extended to more. In the first step, you need to identify the distinct parts of each test:

- The general setup code that must be executed before anything else
- The thread-specific setup code that must run on each thread
- The code for each thread that you want to run concurrently
- The  code  to  be  run  after  the  concurrent  execution  has  finished,  possibly

including assertions on the state of the code

To explain further, let’s consider a specific example from the test list in section 11.2.2:
one thread calling push() on an empty queue while another thread calls pop().

 The general setup code is simple: you must create the queue. The thread executing
pop() has no thread-specific setup code. The thread-specific setup code for the thread
executing push() depends on the interface to the queue and the type of object being
stored. If the object being stored is expensive to construct or must be heap-allocated,
you want to do this as part of the thread-specific setup, so that it doesn’t affect the test.
On the other hand, if the queue is just storing plain ints, there’s nothing to be gained
by constructing an int in the setup code. The code being tested is relatively straightforward—a  call  to  push()  from  one  thread  and  a  call  to  pop()  from  another—but
what about the “after completion” code?

  In  this  case,  it  depends  on  what  you  want  pop()  to  do.  If  it’s  supposed  to  block
until there is data, then clearly you want to see that the returned data is what was supplied to the push() call and that the queue is empty afterward. If pop() is not blocking
and may complete even when the queue is empty, you need to test for two possibilities:
either  the  pop()  returned  the  data  item  supplied  to  the  push()  and  the  queue  is
empty or the pop() signaled that there was no data and the queue has one element.
One or the other must be true; what you want to avoid is the scenario that pop() signaled  “no  data”  but  the  queue  is  empty,  or  that  pop()  returned  the  value  and  the
queue  is  still  not  empty.  In  order  to  simplify  the  test,  assume  you  have  a  blocking
pop(). The final code is therefore an assertion that the popped value is the pushed
value and that the queue is empty.

 Now, having identified the various chunks of code, you need to do the best you can
to  ensure  that  everything  runs  as  planned.  One  way  to  do  this  is  to  use  a  set  of
std::promises  to  indicate  when  everything  is  ready.  Each  thread  sets  a  promise  to
indicate that it’s ready and then waits on a (copy of a) std::shared_future obtained

Techniques for locating concurrency-related bugs

from  a  third  std::promise;  the  main  thread  waits  for  all  the  promises  from  all  the
threads to be set and then triggers the threads to go. This ensures that each thread has
started  and  comes  before  the  chunk  of  code  that  should  be  run  concurrently;  any
thread-specific setup should be done before setting that thread’s promise. Finally, the
main thread waits for the threads to complete and checks the final state. You also need
to be aware of exceptions and make sure you don’t have any threads left waiting for
the go signal when that’s not going to happen. The following listing shows one way of
structuring this test.

    {
        push_done=std::async(std::launch::async,
                             [&q,ready,&push_ready]()
                             {
                                 push_ready.set_value();
                                 ready.wait();
                                 q.push(42);
                             }
            );
        pop_done=std::async(std::launch::async,
                            [&q,ready,&pop_ready]()
                            {
                                pop_ready.set_value();
                                ready.wait();
                                return q.pop();
                            }
            );
        push_ready.get_future().wait();
        pop_ready.get_future().wait();

        throw;
    }
}

The  structure  is  pretty  much  as  described  previously.  First,  you  create  your  empty
queue  as  part  of  the  general  setup  B.  Then,  you  create  all  your  promises  for  the

“ready” signals c and get std::shared_future for the go signal d. Then, you create
the futures you’ll use to indicate that the threads have finished e. These have to go
outside the try block so that you can set the go signal on an exception without waiting
for the test threads to complete (which would deadlock—a deadlock in the test code
would be less than ideal).

  Inside  the  try  block  you  can  then  start  the  threads, f  and g—you  use  std::
launch::async  to  guarantee  that  the  tasks  are  each  running  on  their  own  thread.
Note that the use of std::async makes your exception-safety task easier than it would
be  with  plain  std::thread  because  the  destructor  for  the  future  will  join  with  the
thread. The lambda captures specify that each task will reference the queue and the
relevant promise for signaling readiness, while taking a copy of the ready future you
got from the go promise.

 As described previously, each task sets its own ready signal and then waits for the
general  ready  signal  before  running  the  test  code.  The  main  thread  does  the
reverse—it waits for the signals from both threads i before signaling them to start
the real test j.

 Finally, the main thread calls get() on the futures from the async calls to wait for
the tasks to finish, 1) and 1!, and checks the results. Note that the pop task returns the
retrieved  value  through  the  future h,  so  you  can  use  that  to  get  the  result  for  the
assert 1!.

 If an exception is thrown, you set the go signal to avoid any chance of a dangling
thread and rethrow the exception 1@. The futures corresponding to the tasks e were
declared last, so they’ll be destroyed first, and their destructors will wait for the tasks
to complete, if they haven’t already.

 Although this seems like quite a lot of boilerplate to test two simple calls, it’s necessary to use something similar in order to have the best chance of testing what you want
to test. For example, starting a thread can be quite a time-consuming process, so if you
didn’t make the threads wait for the go signal, then the push thread may have completed before the pop thread even started, which would completely defeat the point
of the test. Using the futures in this way ensures that both threads are running and
blocked on the same future. Unblocking the future then allows both threads to run.
Once you’re familiar with the structure, it should be relatively straightforward to create new tests in the same pattern. For tests that require more than two threads, this
pattern is readily extended to additional threads.

 So far, we’ve been looking at the correctness of multithreaded code. Although this is
the most important issue, it’s not the only reason you test: it’s also important to test
the performance of multithreaded code, so let’s look at that next.

### 11.2.6 Testing the performance of multithreaded code

One of the main reasons you might choose to use concurrency in an application is
to  make  use  of  the  increasing  prevalence  of  multicore  processors  to  improve  the
performance  of  your  applications.  It’s  therefore  important  to  test  your  code  to

### Summary

confirm  that  the  performance  does  indeed  improve,  as  you’d  do  with  any  other
attempt at optimization.

 The particular issue with using concurrency for performance is the scalability—you
want code that runs approximately 24 times faster or processes 24 times as much data
on a 24-core machine as on a single-core machine, all else being equal. You don’t want
code  that  runs  twice  as  fast  on  a  dual-core  machine  but  is  slower  on  a  24-core
machine. As you saw in section 8.4.2, if a significant section of your code runs on only
one thread, this can limit the potential performance gain. It’s therefore worth looking
at the overall design of the code before you start testing, so you know whether you’re
hoping  for  a  factor-of-24  improvement,  or  whether  the  serial  portion  of  your  code
means you’re limited to a maximum of a factor of 3.

 As you’ve already seen in previous chapters, contention between processors for access
to a data structure can have a big performance impact. Something that scales nicely with
the number of processors when that number is small may perform badly when the number of processors is much larger because of the huge increase in contention.

 Consequently, when testing for the performance of multithreaded code, it’s best to
check the performance on systems with as many different configurations as possible, so
you get a picture of the scalability graph. At the very least, you ought to test on a singleprocessor system and a system with as many processing cores as are available to you.

### Summary

In  this  chapter,  we  looked  at  the  various  types  of  concurrency-related  bugs  that  you
might encounter, from deadlocks and livelocks to data races and other problematic race
conditions. We followed that with techniques for locating bugs. These included issues to
think about during code reviews, guidelines for writing testable code, and how to structure tests for concurrent code. Finally, we looked at some utility components that can
help with testing.
