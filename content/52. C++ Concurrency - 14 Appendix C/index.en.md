# Appendix C: A message-passing framework and complete ATM example

A message-passing
framework and complete
ATM example

Back in chapter 4, I presented an example of sending messages between threads
using a message-passing framework, using a simple implementation of the code in
an ATM as an example. What follows is the complete code for this example, including the message-passing framework.

 Listing C.1 shows the message queue. It stores a list of messages as pointers to a
base class; the specific message type is handled with a template class derived from
that base class. Pushing an entry constructs an appropriate instance of the wrapper
class and stores a pointer to it; popping an entry returns that pointer. Because the
message_base  class  doesn’t  have  any  member  functions,  the  popping  thread  will
need  to  cast  the  pointer  to  a  suitable  wrapped_message<T>  pointer  before  it  can
access the stored message.

Listing C.1 A simple message queue

```cpp
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <queue>
#include <memory>
namespace messaging
{
    struct message_base
    {
        virtual ~message_base()
        {}
```

    };

Base class of your
queue entries

Your message
queue

Each message type
has a specialization.

```cpp
    template<typename Msg>
    struct wrapped_message:
```

        message_base
```cpp
    {
```

        Msg contents;
```cpp
        explicit wrapped_message(Msg const& contents_):
            contents(contents_)
        {}
```

    };
```cpp
    class queue
    {
        std::mutex m;
        std::condition_variable c;
        std::queue<std::shared_ptr<message_base> > q;
```

    public:
```cpp
        template<typename T>
        void push(T const& msg)
        {
            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(m);
            q.push(std::make_shared<wrapped_message<T> >(msg));
            c.notify_all();
        }
        std::shared_ptr<message_base> wait_and_pop()
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m);
            c.wait(lk,[&]{return !q.empty();});
            auto res=q.front();
            q.pop();
            return res;
        }
```

    };
```cpp
}

Block until queue
```

isn’t empty

Internal queue stores
pointers to message_base

Wrap posted
message and
store pointer

Sending messages is handled through an instance of the sender class shown in listing C.2. This is a thin wrapper around a message queue that only allows messages to
be pushed. Copying instances of sender copies the pointer to the queue rather than
the queue itself.

Listing C.2 The sender class

sender is a wrapper
around the queue pointer.

```cpp
namespace messaging
{
    class sender
    {
```

        queue*q;
    public:
        sender():
            q(nullptr)
```cpp
        {}
        explicit sender(queue*q_):
            q(q_)
        {}
        template<typename Message>
        void send(Message const& msg)
```

Default-constructed
sender has no queue

Allow construction
from pointer to queue

```cpp
        {
            if(q)
            {
                q->push(msg);
            }
        }
```

    };
```cpp
}

Sending pushes
message on the queue
```

Receiving messages is a bit more complicated. Not only do you have to wait for a message from the queue, but you also have to check to see if the type matches any of the
message  types  being  waited  on  and  call  the  appropriate  handler  function.  This  all
starts with the receiver class, shown in the following listing.

Listing C.3 The receiver class

A receiver owns
the queue.

```cpp
namespace messaging
{
    class receiver
    {
```

        queue q;
    public:
        operator sender()
```cpp
        {
            return sender(&q);
        }
        dispatcher wait()
        {
            return dispatcher(&q);
        }
```

    };
```cpp
}

Allow implicit conversion
to a sender that
references the queue.

Waiting for a queue
creates a dispatcher
```

Whereas a sender references a message queue, a receiver owns it. You can obtain a
sender that references the queue by using the implicit conversion. The complexity of
doing  the  message  dispatch  starts  with  a  call  to  wait().  This  creates  a  dispatcher
object that references the queue from the receiver. The dispatcher class is shown in
the next listing; as you can see, the work is done in the destructor. In this case, that
work consists of waiting for a message and dispatching it.

Listing C.4 The dispatcher class

The message for
closing the queue

```cpp
namespace messaging
{
    class close_queue
```

    {};
```cpp
    class dispatcher
    {
```

        queue* q;
```cpp
        bool chained;
        dispatcher(dispatcher const&)=delete;
        dispatcher& operator=(dispatcher const&)=delete;

dispatcher instances
cannot be copied.
```

b

Loop, waiting for, and
dispatching messages

dispatch() checks
for a close_queue
message, and throws.

Allow TemplateDispatcher
instances to access the
internals.

```cpp
        template<
            typename Dispatcher,
            typename Msg,
            typename Func>
```

        friend class TemplateDispatcher;
```cpp
        void wait_and_dispatch()
        {
            for(;;)
            {
                auto msg=q->wait_and_pop();
                dispatch(msg);
            }
        }
        bool dispatch(
            std::shared_ptr<message_base> const& msg)
        {
            if(dynamic_cast<wrapped_message<close_queue>*>(msg.get()))
            {
                throw close_queue();
            }
            return false;
        }
```

    public:
        dispatcher(dispatcher&& other):
            q(other.q),chained(other.chained)
```cpp
        {
            other.chained=true;
        }
        explicit dispatcher(queue* q_):
            q(q_),chained(false)
        {}
        template<typename Message,typename Func>
```

        TemplateDispatcher<dispatcher,Message,Func>
        handle(Func&& f)
```cpp
        {
            return TemplateDispatcher<dispatcher,Message,Func>(
                q,this,std::forward<Func>(f));
        }
        ~dispatcher() noexcept(false)
        {
            if(!chained)
            {
                wait_and_dispatch();
            }
        }
```

    };
```cpp
}

The destructor might
throw exceptions.

The source shouldn’t
wait for messages.

Dispatcher instances
can be moved.
```

e

Handle a specific type
of message with a
TemplateDispatcher.

The dispatcher instance that’s returned from wait() will be destroyed immediately,
because it’s temporary, and as mentioned, the destructor does the work. The destructor calls wait_and_dispatch(), which is a loop B that waits for a message and passes it
to dispatch(). dispatch() itself c is rather simple, it checks whether the message
is a close_queue message and throws an exception if it is; otherwise, it returns false
to  indicate  that  the  message  was  unhandled.  This  close_queue  exception  is  why  the

destructor is marked noexcept(false); without this annotation, the default exception
specification for the destructor would be noexcept(true) e, indicating that no exceptions can be thrown, and the close_queue exception would terminate the program.

 It’s not often that you’re going to call wait() on its own, though; most of the time
you’ll  want  to  handle  a  message.  This  is  where  the  handle()  member  function  d
comes in. It’s a template, and the message type isn’t deducible, so you must specify
which message type to handle and pass in a function (or callable object) to handle it.
handle()  itself  passes  the  queue,  the  current  dispatcher  object,  and  the  handler
function to a new instance of the TemplateDispatcher class template, to handle messages of the specified type, shown in listing C.5. This is why you test the chained value
in  the  destructor  before  waiting  for  messages;  not  only  does  it  prevent  moved-from
objects waiting for messages, but it also allows you to transfer the responsibility of waiting to your new TemplateDispatcher instance.

Listing C.5 The TemplateDispatcher class template

```cpp
namespace messaging
{
    template<typename PreviousDispatcher,typename Msg,typename Func>
    class TemplateDispatcher
    {
```

        queue* q;
        PreviousDispatcher* prev;
        Func f;
```cpp
        bool chained;
        TemplateDispatcher(TemplateDispatcher const&)=delete;
        TemplateDispatcher& operator=(TemplateDispatcher const&)=delete;
        template<typename Dispatcher,typename OtherMsg,typename OtherFunc>
```

        friend class TemplateDispatcher;
```cpp
        void wait_and_dispatch()
        {
            for(;;)
            {
                auto msg=q->wait_and_pop();
                if(dispatch(msg))
```

                    break;
```cpp
            }
        }
        bool dispatch(std::shared_ptr<message_base> const& msg)
        {
            if(wrapped_message<Msg>* wrapper=
                dynamic_cast<wrapped_message<Msg>*>(msg.get()))
            {
                f(wrapper->contents);
                return true;
            }
```

            else
```cpp
            {
                return prev->dispatch(msg);
            }
        }
```

TemplateDispatcher
instantiations are
friends of each other.

If you handle the message,
break out of the loop.

Chain to the
previous dispatcher.

and call the function. c

Check the message type

B

    public:
        TemplateDispatcher(TemplateDispatcher&& other):
            q(other.q),prev(other.prev),f(std::move(other.f)),
            chained(other.chained)
```cpp
        {
            other.chained=true;
        }
```

        TemplateDispatcher(queue* q_,PreviousDispatcher* prev_,Func&& f_):
```cpp
            q(q_),prev(prev_),f(std::forward<Func>(f_)),chained(false)
        {
            prev_->chained=true;
        }
        template<typename OtherMsg,typename OtherFunc>
```

        TemplateDispatcher<TemplateDispatcher,OtherMsg,OtherFunc>
        handle(OtherFunc&& of)
```cpp
        {
            return TemplateDispatcher<
                TemplateDispatcher,OtherMsg,OtherFunc>(
                    q,this,std::forward<OtherFunc>(of));
        }
        ~TemplateDispatcher() noexcept(false)
        {
            if(!chained)
            {
                wait_and_dispatch();
            }
        }
```

    };
```cpp
}

The destructor is
noexcept(false)
```

again.

Additional handlers
can be chained.

- e

The TemplateDispatcher<> class template is modeled on the dispatcher class and is
almost identical. In particular, the destructor still calls wait_and_dispatch() to wait
for a message.

 Because you don’t throw exceptions if you handle the message, you now need to
check  whether  you  did  handle  the  message  in  your  message  loop B.  Your  message
processing stops when you’ve successfully handled a message, so that you can wait for
a different set of messages next time. If you do get a match for the specified message
type, the supplied function is called c rather than throwing an exception (although
the  handler  function  may  throw  an  exception  itself).  If  you  don’t  get  a  match,  you
chain to the previous dispatcher d. In the first instance, this will be a dispatcher, but
if you chain calls to handle() e to allow multiple types of messages to be handled, this
may be a prior instantiation of TemplateDispatcher<>, which will in turn chain to the
previous  handler  if  the  message  doesn’t  match.  Because  any  of  the  handlers  might
throw an exception (including the dispatcher’s default handler for close_queue messages), the destructor must once again be declared noexcept(false) f.

 This simple framework allows you to push any type of message on the queue and
then selectively match against messages you can handle on the receiving end. It also
allows  you  to  pass  around  a  reference  to  the  queue  for  pushing  messages  on,  while
keeping the receiving end private.

 To complete the example from chapter 4, the messages are given in listing C.6, the
various state machines in listings C.7, C.8, and C.9, and the driving code in listing C.10.
