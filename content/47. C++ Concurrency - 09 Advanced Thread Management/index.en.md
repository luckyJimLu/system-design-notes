# Chapter 9: Advanced thread management

Advanced thread
management

This chapter covers

- Thread pools
- Handling dependencies between pool tasks
- Work stealing for pool threads
- Interrupting threads

In earlier chapters, you’ve been explicitly managing threads by creating std::thread
objects for every thread. In a couple of places you’ve seen how this can be undesirable,  because  you  then  have  to  manage  the  lifetime  of  the  thread  objects,  determine  the  number  of  threads  appropriate  to  the  problem  and  to  the  current
hardware, and so forth. The ideal scenario would be that you could divide the code
into the smallest pieces that could be executed concurrently, pass them over to the
compiler and library, and say, “Parallelize this for optimal performance.” As we'll
see in chapter 10, there are cases where you can do this: if your code that requires
parallelization can be expressed as a call to a standard library algorithm, then you
can ask the library to do the parallelization for you in most cases.

 Another recurring theme in several of the examples is that you might use several threads to solve a problem but require that they finish early if some condition
is met. This might be because the result has already been determined, or because

## 9.1 Thread pools

an error has occurred, or even because the user has explicitly requested that the operation  be  aborted.  Whatever  the  reason,  the  threads  need  to  be  sent  a  “Please  stop”
request so that they can give up on the task they were given, tidy up, and finish as soon
as possible.

 In this chapter, we’ll look at mechanisms for managing threads and tasks, starting
with the automatic management of the number of threads and the division of tasks
between them.

Thread pools
In many companies, employees who would normally spend their time in the office are
occasionally required to visit clients or suppliers or to attend a trade show or conference. Although these trips might be necessary, and on any given day there might be
several  people  making  this  trip,  it  may  well  be  months  or  even  years  between  these
trips for any particular employee. Because it would therefore be rather expensive and
impractical for each employee to have a company car, companies often offer a car pool
instead; they have a limited number of cars that are available to all employees. When
an  employee  needs  to  make  an  off-site  trip,  they  book  one  of  the  pool  cars  for  the
appropriate  time  and  return  it  for  others  to  use  when  they  return  to  the  office.  If
there are no pool cars free on a given day, the employee will have to reschedule their
trip for a subsequent date.

  A  thread  pool  is  a  similar  idea,  except  that  threads  are  being  shared  rather  than
cars. On most systems, it’s impractical to have a separate thread for every task that
can potentially be done in parallel with other tasks, but you’d still like to take advantage of the available concurrency where possible. A thread pool allows you to accomplish this; tasks that can be executed concurrently are submitted to the pool, which
puts them on a queue of pending work. Each task is then taken from the queue by
one of the worker threads, which executes the task before looping back to take another
from the queue.

 There are several key design issues when building a thread pool, such as how many
threads to use, the most efficient way to allocate tasks to threads, and whether or not
you  can  wait  for  a  task  to  complete.  In  this  section  we’ll  look  at  some  thread  pool
implementations that address these design issues, starting with the simplest possible
thread pool.

### 9.1.1 The simplest possible thread pool

At  its  simplest,  a  thread  pool  is  a  fixed  number  of  worker  threads  (typically  the  same
number as the value returned by std::thread::hardware_concurrency()) that process work. When you have work to do, you call a function to put it on the queue of
pending work. Each worker thread takes work off the queue, runs the specified task,
and then goes back to the queue for more work. In the simplest case there’s no way to
wait for the task to complete. If you need to do this, you have to manage the synchronization yourself.

 The following listing shows a sample implementation of this thread pool.

    void worker_thread()
    {
        while(!done)
        {
            std::function<void()> task;
            if(work_queue.try_pop(task))
            {
                task();
            }
```

            else
```cpp
            {
                std::this_thread::yield();
            }
        }
    }
```

        unsigned const thread_count=std::thread::hardware_concurrency();

```cpp
        {
            for(unsigned i=0;i<thread_count;++i)
            {
                threads.push_back(
                    std::thread(&thread_pool::worker_thread,this));
            }

    {
        work_queue.push(std::function<void()>(f));
    }
```

Thread pools

This implementation has a vector of worker threads c and uses one of the thread-safe
queues from chapter 6 B to manage the queue of work. In this case, users can’t wait for
the tasks, and they can’t return any values, so you can use std::function<void()> to
encapsulate your tasks. The submit() function then wraps whatever function or callable object is supplied inside an std::function<void()> instance and pushes it on
the queue 1@.

  The  threads  are  started  in  the  constructor:  you  use  std::thread::hardware_
concurrency()  to  tell  you  how  many  concurrent  threads  the  hardware  can  support
i, and you create that many threads running your worker_thread() member function j.

 Starting a thread can fail by throwing an exception, so you need to ensure that any
threads you’ve already started are stopped and cleaned up nicely in this case. This is
achieved with a try-catch block that sets the done flag when an exception is thrown
1), alongside an instance of the join_threads class from chapter 8 d to join all the
threads. This also works with the destructor: you can set the done flag 1!, and the
join_threads  instance  will  ensure  that  all  the  threads  have  completed  before  the
pool  is  destroyed.  Note  that  the  order  of  declaration  of  the  members  is  important:
both the done flag and the worker_queue must be declared before the threads vector,
which must in turn be declared before the joiner. This ensures that the members are
destroyed in the right order; you can’t destroy the queue safely until all the threads
have stopped, for example.

 The worker_thread function itself is quite simple: it sits in a loop waiting until the
done flag is set e, pulling tasks off the queue f and executing them g in the meantime.  If  there  are  no  tasks  on  the  queue,  the  function  calls  std::this_thread::
yield() to take a small break h and give another thread a chance to put some work
on the queue before it tries to take some off again the next time around.

 For many purposes this simple thread pool will suffice, especially if the tasks are
entirely  independent  and  don’t  return  any  values  or  perform  any  blocking  operations. But there are also many circumstances where this simple thread pool may not
adequately address your needs, and yet others where it can cause problems such as
deadlock.  Also,  in  simple  cases  you  may  be  better  served  using  std::async  as  in
many of the examples in chapter 8. Throughout this chapter, we’ll look at more complex  thread  pool  implementations  that  have  additional  features  either  to  address
user needs or reduce the potential for problems. First up: waiting for the tasks we’ve
submitted.

### 9.1.2 Waiting for tasks submitted to a thread pool

In the examples in chapter 8 that explicitly spawned threads, after dividing the work
between  threads,  the  master  thread  always  waited  for  the  newly  spawned  threads  to
finish, to ensure that the overall task was complete before returning to the caller. With
thread pools, you’d need to wait for the tasks submitted to the thread pool to complete, rather than the worker threads themselves. This is similar to the way that the

std::async-based  examples  in  chapter  8  waited  for  the  futures.  With  the  simple
thread pool from listing 9.1, you’d have to do this manually using the techniques from
be better if you could wait for the tasks directly.

 By moving that complexity into the thread pool itself, you can wait for the tasks
directly. You can have the submit() function return a task handle of some description
that you can then use to wait for the task to complete. This task handle would wrap the
use of condition variables or futures, simplifying the code that uses the thread pool.

 A special case of having to wait for the spawned task to finish occurs when the main
thread needs a result computed by the task. You’ve seen this in examples throughout
the book, such as the parallel_accumulate() function from chapter 2. In this case,
you can combine the waiting with the result transfer through the use of futures. Listing 9.2 shows the changes required to the simple thread pool that allow you to wait
for  tasks  to  complete  and  then  pass  return  values  from  the  task  to  the  waiting
thread. Because std::packaged_task<> instances are not copyable, just movable, you
can no longer use std::function<> for the queue entries, because std::function<>
requires that the stored function objects are copy-constructible. Instead, you must
use  a  custom  function  wrapper  that  can  handle  move-only  types.  This  is  a  simple
type-erasure class with a function call operator. You only need to handle functions
that take no parameters and return void, so this is a straightforward virtual call in
the implementation.

Listing 9.2 A thread pool with waitable tasks

```cpp
class function_wrapper
{
    struct impl_base {
        virtual void call()=0;
        virtual ~impl_base() {}
```

    };
```cpp
    std::unique_ptr<impl_base> impl;
    template<typename F>
    struct impl_type: impl_base
    {
```

        F f;
```cpp
        impl_type(F&& f_): f(std::move(f_)) {}
        void call() { f(); }
```

    };
public:
```cpp
    template<typename F>
```

    function_wrapper(F&& f):
```cpp
        impl(new impl_type<F>(std::move(f)))
    {}
    void operator()() { impl->call(); }
    function_wrapper() = default;
```

    function_wrapper(function_wrapper&& other):
```cpp
        impl(std::move(other.impl))
    {}

Thread pools

Use function_
wrapper rather
than std::function

    function_wrapper& operator=(function_wrapper&& other)
    {
        impl=std::move(other.impl);
        return *this;
    }
    function_wrapper(const function_wrapper&)=delete;
    function_wrapper(function_wrapper&)=delete;
    function_wrapper& operator=(const function_wrapper&)=delete;
```

};
```cpp
class thread_pool
{
    thread_safe_queue<function_wrapper> work_queue;
    void worker_thread()
    {
        while(!done)
        {
```

            function_wrapper task;
```cpp
            if(work_queue.try_pop(task))
            {
                task();
            }
```

            else
```cpp
            {
                std::this_thread::yield();
            }
        }
    }
```

public:
```cpp
    template<typename FunctionType>
    std::future<typename std::result_of<FunctionType()>::type>
        submit(FunctionType f)
    {
        typedef typename std::result_of<FunctionType()>::type
```

            result_type;
```cpp
        std::packaged_task<result_type()> task(std::move(f));
```

 e
```cpp
        std::future<result_type> res(task.get_future());
        work_queue.push(std::move(task));
```

g
```cpp
        return res;
    }
    // rest as before
```

};

- b

First, the modified submit() function B returns a std::future<> to hold the return
value of the task and allow the caller to wait for the task to complete. This requires
that  you  know  the  return  type  of  the  supplied  function  f,  which  is  where  std::
result_of<>  comes  in:  std::result_of<FunctionType()>::type  is  the  type  of  the
result of invoking an instance of type FunctionType (such as f) with no arguments.
You  use  the  same  std::result_of<>  expression  for  the  result_type  typedef  c
inside the function.

  You  then  wrap  the  function  f  in  a  std::packaged_task<result_type()>  d,
because  f  is  a  function  or  callable  object  that  takes  no  parameters  and  returns  an
instance of type result_type, as we deduced. You can now get your future from the

std::packaged_task<> e before pushing the task onto the queue f and returning
the future g. Note that you have to use std::move() when pushing the task onto
the  queue,  because  std::packaged_task<>  isn’t  copyable.  The  queue  now  stores
```cpp
function_wrapper  objects  rather  than  std::function<void()>  objects  in  order  to
handle this.
```

 This pool allows you to wait for your tasks and have them return results. The next
listing shows what the parallel_accumulate function looks like with this thread pool.

Listing 9.3 parallel_accumulate using a thread pool with waitable tasks

```cpp
template<typename Iterator,typename T>
T parallel_accumulate(Iterator first,Iterator last,T init)
{
    unsigned long const length=std::distance(first,last);
    if(!length)
        return init;
    unsigned long const block_size=25;
    unsigned long const num_blocks=(length+block_size-1)/block_size;
    std::vector<std::future<T> > futures(num_blocks-1);
```

    thread_pool pool;
```cpp
    Iterator block_start=first;
    for(unsigned long i=0;i<(num_blocks-1);++i)
    {
        Iterator block_end=block_start;
        std::advance(block_end,block_size);
        futures[i]=pool.submit([=]{
            accumulate_block<Iterator,T>()(block_start,block_end);
        });
        block_start=block_end;
    }
    T last_result=accumulate_block<Iterator,T>()(block_start,last);
    T result=init;
    for(unsigned long i=0;i<(num_blocks-1);++i)
    {
        result+=futures[i].get();
    }
    result += last_result;
    return result;
}
```

When you compare this against listing 8.4, there are a couple of things to notice. First,
you’re working in terms of the number of blocks to use (num_blocks) B rather than
the number of threads. In order to make the most use of the scalability of your thread
pool, you need to divide the work into the smallest blocks that it’s worth working with
concurrently. When there are only a few threads in the pool, each thread will process
many blocks, but as the number of threads grows with the hardware, the number of
blocks processed in parallel will also grow.

 You need to be careful when choosing the “smallest blocks worth working with concurrently.” There’s an inherent overhead to submitting a task to a thread pool, having
the worker thread run it, and passing the return value through a std::future<>, and

Thread pools

for small tasks it’s not worth the payoff. If you choose too small a task size, the code
may run more slowly with a thread pool than with one thread.

 Assuming the block size is sensible, you don’t have to worry about packaging the
tasks, obtaining the futures, or storing the std::thread objects so you can join with
the threads later; the thread pool takes care of that. All you need to do is call submit()
with your task c.

 The thread pool takes care of the exception safety too. Any exception thrown by
the task gets propagated through the future returned from submit(), and if the function exits with an exception, the thread pool destructor abandons any not-yet-completed
tasks and waits for the pool threads to finish.

 This works well for simple cases like this, where the tasks are independent. But it’s
not so good for situations where the tasks depend on other tasks also submitted to the
thread pool.

### 9.1.3 Tasks that wait for other tasks

The Quicksort algorithm is an example that I’ve used throughout this book. It’s simple in concept: the data to be sorted is partitioned into those items that go before a
pivot item and those that go after it in the sorted sequence. These two sets of items are
recursively  sorted  and  then  stitched  back  together  to  form  a  fully  sorted  set.  When
parallelizing this algorithm, you need to ensure that these recursive calls make use of
the available concurrency.

 Back in chapter 4, when I first introduced this example, you used std::async to
run one of the recursive calls at each stage, letting the library choose between running
it on a new thread and running it synchronously when the relevant get() was called.
This  works  well,  because  each  task  is  either  running  on  its  own  thread  or  will  be
invoked when required.

 When we revisited the implementation in chapter 8, you saw an alternative structure  that  used  a  fixed  number  of  threads  related  to  the  available  hardware  concurrency. In this case, you used a stack of pending chunks that needed sorting. As each
thread partitioned the data it was sorting, it added a new chunk to the stack for one of
the sets of data and then sorted the other one directly. At this point, a straightforward
wait  for  the  sorting  of  the  other  chunk  to  complete  would  potentially  deadlock,
because you’d be consuming one of your limited number of threads waiting. It would
be easy to end up in a situation where all of the threads were waiting for chunks to be
sorted and no threads were doing any sorting. We addressed this issue by having the
threads pull chunks off the stack and sort them while the particular chunk they were
waiting for was unsorted.

 You’d get the same problem if you substituted a simple thread pool like the ones
you’ve seen so far in this chapter, instead of std::async in the example from chapter 4.
There are now only a limited number of threads, and they might end up all waiting
for tasks that haven’t been scheduled because there are no free threads. You therefore
need to use a solution similar to the one you used in chapter 8: process outstanding

chunks while you’re waiting for your chunk to complete. If you’re using the thread
pool to manage the list of tasks and their association with threads—which is, after all,
the whole point of using a thread pool—you don’t have access to the task list to do
this. What you need to do is modify the thread pool to do this automatically.

 The simplest way to do this is to add a new function on thread_pool to run a task
from the queue and manage the loop yourself, so we’ll go with that. Advanced thread
pool implementations might add logic into the wait function or additional wait functions to handle this case, possibly prioritizing the task being waited for. The following
listing  shows  the  new  run_pending_task()  function,  and  a  modified  Quicksort  to
make use of it is shown in listing 9.5.

Listing 9.4 An implementation of run_pending_task()

```cpp
void thread_pool::run_pending_task()
{
```

    function_wrapper task;
```cpp
    if(work_queue.try_pop(task))
    {
        task();
    }
```

    else
```cpp
    {
        std::this_thread::yield();
    }
}
```

This implementation of run_pending_task() is lifted straight out of the main loop of
the  worker_thread()  function,  which  can  now  be  modified  to  call  the  extracted
run_pending_task(). This tries to take a task off the queue and run it if there is one;
otherwise,  it  yields  to  allow  the  OS  to  reschedule  the  thread.  The  Quicksort  implementation in listing 9.5 is a lot simpler than the corresponding version from listing
8.1, because all the thread-management logic has been moved to the thread pool.

Listing 9.5 A thread-pool–based implementation of Quicksort

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct sorter
{
```

    thread_pool pool;

b

```cpp
    std::list<T> do_sort(std::list<T>& chunk_data)
    {
        if(chunk_data.empty())
        {
            return chunk_data;
        }
        std::list<T> result;
        result.splice(result.begin(),chunk_data,chunk_data.begin());
        T const& partition_val=*result.begin();

Thread pools

        typename std::list<T>::iterator divide_point=
            std::partition(chunk_data.begin(),chunk_data.end(),
                           [&](T const& val){return val<partition_val;});
        std::list<T> new_lower_chunk;
        new_lower_chunk.splice(new_lower_chunk.end(),
                               chunk_data,chunk_data.begin(),
                               divide_point);
        std::future<std::list<T> > new_lower=
            pool.submit(std::bind(&sorter::do_sort,this,
                                  std::move(new_lower_chunk)));
        std::list<T> new_higher(do_sort(chunk_data));
        result.splice(result.end(),new_higher);
        while(new_lower.wait_for(std::chrono::seconds(0)) ==
            std::future_status::timeout)
        {
            pool.run_pending_task();
        }
        result.splice(result.begin(),new_lower.get());
        return result;
    }
```

};
```cpp
template<typename T>
std::list<T> parallel_quick_sort(std::list<T> input)
{
    if(input.empty())
    {
        return input;
    }
    sorter<T> s;
    return s.do_sort(input);
}
```

e

As in listing 8.1, you’ve delegated the real work to the do_sort() member function of
the sorter class template B, although in this case the class is only there to wrap the
thread_pool instance c.

  Your  thread  and  task  management  are  now  reduced  to  submitting  a  task  to  the
pool d and running pending tasks while waiting e. This is much simpler than in listing 8.1, where you had to explicitly manage the threads and the stack of chunks to
sort. When submitting the task to the pool, you use std::bind() to bind the this
pointer to do_sort() and to supply the chunk to sort. In this case, you call std::move()
on new_lower_chunk as you pass it in, to ensure that the data is moved rather than
copied.

 Although this has now addressed the crucial deadlock-causing problem with tasks
that wait for other tasks, this thread pool is still far from ideal. For starters, every call to
submit() and every call to run_pending_task()accesses the same queue. You saw in
rimental effect on performance, so you need to address this problem.

### 9.1.4 Avoiding contention on the work queue

Every time a thread calls submit() on a particular instance of the thread pool, it has
to push a new item onto the single shared work queue. Likewise, the worker threads
are continually popping items off the queue in order to run the tasks. This means that
as  the  number  of  processors  increases,  there’s  increasing  contention  on  the  queue.
This can be a real performance drain; even if you use a lock-free queue so there’s no
explicit waiting, cache ping-pong can be a substantial time sink.

  One  way  to  avoid  cache  ping-pong  is  to  use  a  separate  work  queue  per  thread.
Each thread then posts new items to its  own queue and takes work from the global
work queue only if there’s no work on its own individual queue. The following listing
shows an implementation that makes use of a  thread_local variable to ensure that
each thread has its own work queue, as well as the global one.

Listing 9.6 A thread pool with thread-local work queues

```cpp
class thread_pool
{
    threadsafe_queue<function_wrapper> pool_work_queue;
    typedef std::queue<function_wrapper> local_queue_type;
    static thread_local std::unique_ptr<local_queue_type>
```

        local_work_queue;
```cpp
    void worker_thread()
    {
        local_work_queue.reset(new local_queue_type);
```

b

```cpp
        while(!done)
        {
            run_pending_task();
        }

public:

        typedef typename std::result_of<FunctionType()>::type result_type;
        std::packaged_task<result_type()> task(f);
        std::future<result_type> res(task.get_future());
```

e
```cpp
        if(local_work_queue)
        {
            local_work_queue->push(std::move(task));
        }
```

        else

You’ve  used  a  std::unique_ptr<>  to  hold  the  thread-local  work  queue c  because
you don’t want other threads that aren't part of your thread pool to have one; this is
initialized in the worker_thread() function before the processing loop d. The destructor  of  std::unique_ptr<>  will  ensure  that  the  work  queue  is  destroyed  when  the
thread exits.

 submit() then checks to see if the current thread has a work queue e. If it does,
it’s a pool thread, and you can put the task on the local queue; otherwise, you need to
put the task on the pool queue as before f.

 There’s a similar check in run_pending_task() g, except this time you also need
to check to see if there are any items on the local queue. If there are, you can take the
front one and process it; notice that the local queue can be a plain std::queue< B
because it’s only ever accessed by the one thread. If there are no tasks on the local
queue, you try the pool queue as before h.

  This  works  fine  for  reducing  contention,  but  when  the  distribution  of  work  is
uneven, it can easily result in one thread having a lot of work in its queue while the
others have no work do to. For example, with the Quicksort example, only the topmost chunk would make it to the pool queue, because the remaining chunks would
end up on the local queue of the worker thread that processed that one. This defeats
the purpose of using a thread pool.

  Thankfully,  there  is  a  solution  to  this:  allow  the  threads  to  steal  work  from  each

other’s queues if there’s no work in their queue and no work in the global queue.

### 9.1.5 Work stealing

In order to allow a thread with no work to do to take work from another thread with a
full queue, the queue must be accessible to the thread doing the stealing from run_
pending_tasks().  This  requires  that  each  thread  register  its  queue  with  the  thread
pool or be given one by the thread pool. Also, you must ensure that the data in the work
queue is suitably synchronized and protected so that your invariants are protected.

 It’s possible to write a lock-free queue that allows the owner thread to push and
pop at one end while other threads can steal entries from the other, but the implementation of this queue is beyond the scope of this book. In order to demonstrate the
idea, we’ll stick to using a mutex to protect the queue’s data. We hope work stealing is
a rare event, so there should be little contention on the mutex, and this simple queue
should  therefore  have  minimal  overhead.  A  simple  lock-based  implementation  is
shown here.

Listing 9.7 Lock-based queue for work stealing

b

```cpp
class work_stealing_queue
{
```

private:
```cpp
    typedef function_wrapper data_type;
    std::deque<data_type> the_queue;
    mutable std::mutex the_mutex;
```

public:
    work_stealing_queue()
```cpp
    {}
    work_stealing_queue(const work_stealing_queue& other)=delete;
    work_stealing_queue& operator=(
        const work_stealing_queue& other)=delete;
    void push(data_type data)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(the_mutex);
        the_queue.push_front(std::move(data));
    }
    bool empty() const
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(the_mutex);
        return the_queue.empty();
    }
    bool try_pop(data_type& res)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(the_mutex);
        if(the_queue.empty())
        {
            return false;
        }
        res=std::move(the_queue.front());
        the_queue.pop_front();
        return true;
    }
    bool try_steal(data_type& res)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(the_mutex);
        if(the_queue.empty())
        {
            return false;
        }
        res=std::move(the_queue.back());
        the_queue.pop_back();
        return true;
```

e

Thread pools

```cpp
    }
```

};

This  queue  is  a  simple  wrapper  around  a  std::deque<function_wrapper>  B  that
protects all accesses with a mutex lock. Both push() c and try_pop() d work on the
front of the queue, while try_steal() e works on the back.

 This means that this “queue” is a last-in-first-out stack for its own thread; the task
most recently pushed on is the first one off again. This can help improve performance
from a cache perspective, because the data related to that task is more likely to still be
in the cache than the data related to a task pushed on the queue previously. Also, it
maps  nicely  to  algorithms  such  as  Quicksort.  In  the  previous  implementation,  each
call to do_sort() pushes one item on the stack and then waits for it. By processing the
most recent item first, you ensure that the chunk needed for the current call to complete  is  processed  before  the  chunks  needed  for  the  other  branches,  reducing  the
number  of  active  tasks  and  the  total  stack  usage.  try_steal()  takes  items  from  the
opposite end of the queue to try_pop() in order to minimize contention; you could
potentially use the techniques discussed in chapters 6 and 7 to enable concurrent calls
to try_pop() and try_steal().

 OK, so you have your nice sparkly work queue that permits stealing; how do you

use it in your thread pool? Here’s one potential implementation.

j

This  code  is  similar  to  listing  9.6.  The  first  difference  is  that  each  thread  has  a
work_stealing_queue rather than a plain std::queue<> c. When each thread is created, rather than allocating its own work queue, the pool constructor allocates one g,
which is then stored in the list of work queues for this pool B. The index of the queue
in the list is then passed in to the thread function and used to retrieve the pointer to
the queue d. This means that the thread pool can access the queue when trying to
steal a task for a thread that has no work to do. run_pending_task() will now try to
take a task from its thread’s own queue h, take a task from the pool queue i, or take
a task from the queue of another thread j.

 pop_task_from_other_thread_queue() e iterates through the queues belonging
to all the threads in the pool, trying to steal a task from each in turn. In order to
avoid every thread trying to steal from the first thread in the list, each thread starts
at the next thread in the list by offsetting the index of the queue to check by its own
index f.

 Now you have a working thread pool that’s good for many potential uses. There
are still a myriad of ways to improve it for any particular usage, but that’s left as an
exercise for the reader. One aspect that hasn’t been explored is the idea of dynamically  resizing  the  thread  pool  to  ensure  that  there’s  optimal  CPU  usage  even  when
threads are blocked waiting for something such as I/O or a mutex lock.

  Next  on  the  list  of  “advanced”  thread-management  techniques  is  interrupting

threads.

## 9.2 Interrupting threads

In many situations it’s desirable to signal to a long-running thread that it’s time to
stop. This might be because it’s a worker thread for a thread pool and the pool is
now being destroyed, or because the work being done by the thread has been explicitly canceled by the user, or a myriad of other reasons. Whatever the reason, the idea
is the same: you need to signal from one thread that another should stop before it

reaches  the  natural  end  of  its  processing,  and  you  need  to  do  this  in  a  way  that
allows that thread to terminate nicely rather than abruptly pulling the rug out from
under it.

 You could potentially design a separate mechanism for every case where you need
to do this, but that would be overkill. Not only does a common mechanism make it
easier to write the code on subsequent occasions, but it can allow you to write code
that can be interrupted, without having to worry about where that code is being used.
The C++11 Standard doesn’t provide this mechanism (though there is an active proposal  for  adding  interrupt  support  to  a  future  C++  standard1),  but  it’s  relatively
straightforward  to  build  one.  Let’s  look  at  how  you  can  do  that,  starting  from  the
point of view of the interface for launching and interrupting a thread rather than that
of the thread being interrupted.

### 9.2.1 Launching and interrupting another thread

To start with, let’s look at the external interface. What do you need from an interruptible  thread?  At  the  basic  level,  all  you  need  is  the  same  interface  as  you  have  for
```cpp
std::thread, with an additional interrupt() function:

class interruptible_thread
{
```

public:
```cpp
    template<typename FunctionType>
    interruptible_thread(FunctionType f);
    void join();
    void detach();
    bool joinable() const;
    void interrupt();
```

};

Internally, you can use std::thread to manage the thread itself and use some custom
data structure to handle the interruption. Now, what about from the point of view of
the  thread  itself?  At  the  most  basic  level  you  want  to  be  able  to  say  “I  can  be  interrupted here”—you want an interruption point. For this to be usable without having to
pass down additional data, it needs to be a simple function that can be called without
any  parameters:  interruption_point().  This  implies  that  the  interruption-specific
data structure needs to be accessible through a thread_local variable that’s set when
the  thread  is  started,  so  that  when  a  thread  calls  your  interruption_point()  function, it checks the data structure for the currently-executing thread. We’ll look at the
implementation of interruption_point() later.

 This thread_local flag is the primary reason you can’t use plain std::thread to
manage the thread; it needs to be allocated in a way that the interruptible_thread
instance can access, as well as the newly started thread. You can do this by wrapping

Interrupting threads

the supplied function before you pass it to std::thread to launch the thread in the
constructor, as shown in the next listing.

Listing 9.9 Basic implementation of interruptible_thread

b

```cpp
class interrupt_flag
{
```

public:
```cpp
    void set();
    bool is_set() const;
```

};
thread_local interrupt_flag this_thread_interrupt_flag;
```cpp
class interruptible_thread
{
    std::thread internal_thread;
```

    interrupt_flag* flag;
public:
```cpp
    template<typename FunctionType>
    interruptible_thread(FunctionType f)
    {
        std::promise<interrupt_flag*> p;
        internal_thread=std::thread([f,&p]{
                p.set_value(&this_thread_interrupt_flag);
```

e
```cpp
                f();
            });
        flag=p.get_future().get();
    }
    void interrupt()
    {
        if(flag)
        {
            flag->set();
        }
    }
```

};

- g

The supplied function f is wrapped in a lambda function d, which holds a copy of - and a reference to the local promise, p c. The lambda sets the value of the promise
to the address of the this_thread_interrupt_flag (which is declared thread_local
B)  for  the  new  thread  before  invoking  the  copy  of  the  supplied  function e.  The
calling thread then waits for the future associated with the promise to become ready
and  stores  the  result  in  the  flag  member  variable  f.  Note  that  even  though  the
lambda is running on the new thread and has a dangling reference to the local variable, p, this is OK because the interruptible_thread constructor waits until p is no
longer  referenced  by  the  new  thread  before  returning.  Note  that  this  implementation doesn’t take account of handling joining with the thread, or detaching it. You
need to ensure that the flag variable is cleared when the thread exits, or is detached,
to avoid a dangling pointer.

  The  interrupt()  function  is  then  relatively  straightforward:  if  you  have  a  valid
pointer to an interrupt flag, you have a thread to interrupt, so you can set the flag g.

It’s then up to the interrupted thread what it does with the interruption. Let’s explore
that next.

### 9.2.2 Detecting that a thread has been interrupted

You can now set the interruption flag, but that doesn’t do you any good if the thread
doesn’t check whether it’s being interrupted. In the simplest case you can do this with
an  interruption_point()  function;  you  can  call  this  function  at  a  point  where  it’s
safe to be interrupted, and it throws a thread_interrupted exception if the flag is set:

```cpp
void interruption_point()
{
    if(this_thread_interrupt_flag.is_set())
    {
        throw thread_interrupted();
    }
}
```

You can use this function by calling it at convenient points within your code:

```cpp
void foo()
{
    while(!done)
    {
        interruption_point();
        process_next_item();
    }
}
```

Although this works, it’s not ideal. Some of the best places for interrupting a thread
are where it’s blocked waiting for something, which means that the thread isn’t running in order to call interruption_point()! What you need here is a means for waiting for something in an interruptible fashion.

### 9.2.3 Interrupting a condition variable wait

OK,  so  you  can  detect  interruptions  at  carefully  chosen  places  in  your  code,  with
explicit calls to interruption_point(), but that doesn’t help when you want to do a
blocking wait, such as waiting for a condition variable to be notified. You need a new
function—interruptible_wait()—which  you  can  then  overload  for  the  various
things you might want to wait for, and you can work out how to interrupt the waiting.
I’ve already mentioned that one thing you might be waiting for is a condition variable,
so let’s start there: what do you need to do in order to be able to interrupt a wait on a
condition variable? The simplest thing that would work is to notify the condition variable  once  you’ve  set  the  interrupt  flag,  and  put  an  interruption  point  immediately
after the wait. But for this to work, you’d have to notify all threads waiting on the condition variable in order to ensure that your thread of interest wakes up. Waiters have
to handle spurious wake-ups anyway, so other threads would handle this the same as a
spurious wake-up—they wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. The interrupt_flag

Interrupting threads

structure would need to be able to store a pointer to a condition variable so that it can
be notified in a call to set(). One possible implementation of interruptible_wait()
for condition variables might look like the following listing.

```cpp
Listing 9.10 A broken version of interruptible_wait for std::condition
```

_variable

```cpp
void interruptible_wait(std::condition_variable& cv,
                        std::unique_lock<std::mutex>& lk)
{
    interruption_point();
    this_thread_interrupt_flag.set_condition_variable(cv);
    cv.wait(lk);
    this_thread_interrupt_flag.clear_condition_variable();
    interruption_point();
}
```

b

Assuming the presence of some functions for setting and clearing an association of a
condition variable with an interrupt flag, this code is nice and simple. It checks for
interruption,  associates  the  condition  variable  with  interrupt_flag  for  the  current
thread B, waits on the condition variable c, clears the association with the condition
variable d, and checks for interruption again. If the thread is interrupted during the
wait  on  the  condition  variable,  the  interrupting  thread  will  broadcast  the  condition
variable and wake you from the wait, so you can check for interruption. Unfortunately,
this code is broken: there are two problems with it. The first problem is relatively obvious if you have your exception safety hat on: std::condition_variable::wait() can
throw an exception, so you might exit the function without removing the association
of the interrupt flag with the condition variable. This is easily fixed with a structure
that removes the association in its destructor.

 The second, less obvious problem is that there’s a race condition. If the thread is
interrupted  after  the  initial  call  to  interruption_point(),  but  before  the  call  to
wait(), then it doesn’t matter whether the condition variable has been associated with
the interrupt flag, because the thread isn’t waiting and so can’t be woken by a notify on the
condition variable. You need to ensure that the thread can’t be notified between the last
check for interruption and the call to wait(). Without delving into the internals of
std::condition_variable, you have only one way of doing that: use the mutex held
by  lk  to  protect  this  too,  which  requires  passing  it  in  on  the  call  to  set_condition
_variable(). Unfortunately, this creates its own problems: you’d be passing a reference to a mutex whose lifetime you don’t know to another thread (the thread doing
the interrupting) for that thread to lock (in the call to interrupt()), without knowing whether that thread has locked the mutex already when it makes the call. This has
the potential for deadlock and the potential to access a mutex after it has already been
destroyed, so it’s a nonstarter. It would be rather too restrictive if you couldn’t reliably
interrupt  a  condition  variable  wait—you  can  do  almost  as  well  without  a  special
interruptible_wait()—so what other options do you have? One option is to put a

timeout on the wait; use wait_for() rather than  wait() with a small timeout value
(such  as  1  ms).  This  puts  an  upper  limit  on  how  long  the  thread  will  have  to  wait
before it sees the interruption (subject to the tick granularity of the clock). If you do
this, the waiting thread will see more “spurious” wakes resulting from the timeout, but
it can’t easily be helped. This implementation is shown in the next listing, along with
the corresponding implementation of interrupt_flag.

```cpp
Listing 9.11 Using a timeout in interruptible_wait for std::condition

{
    std::atomic<bool> flag;
    std::condition_variable* thread_cond;

public:
    interrupt_flag():
        thread_cond(0)
```cpp

        flag.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);

        if(thread_cond)
        {
            thread_cond->notify_all();
        }
    }
    bool is_set() const

        return flag.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
    }
    void set_condition_variable(std::condition_variable& cv)
    {

        thread_cond=&cv;
    }

        ~clear_cv_on_destruct()
        {

        }
```

    };
};

{

    cv.wait_for(lk,std::chrono::milliseconds(1));
    interruption_point();
}
```

If you have the predicate that’s being waited for, then the 1 ms timeout can be completely hidden inside the predicate loop:

                        std::unique_lock<std::mutex>& lk,

{
    interruption_point();
    this_thread_interrupt_flag.set_condition_variable(cv);
    interrupt_flag::clear_cv_on_destruct guard;
    while(!this_thread_interrupt_flag.is_set() && !pred())
    {
        cv.wait_for(lk,std::chrono::milliseconds(1));
    }
    interruption_point();
}
```

This will result in the predicate being checked more often than it might otherwise be,
but it’s easily used in place of a plain call to wait(). The variants with timeouts are easily implemented: wait either for the time specified, or 1 ms, whichever is shortest. OK,
so std::condition_variable waits are now taken care of; what about std::condition
_variable_any? Is this the same, or can you do better?

### 9.2.4 Interrupting a wait on std::condition_variable_any

std::condition_variable_any differs from std::condition_variable in that it works
with  any  lock  type  rather  than  just  std::unique_lock<std::mutex>.  It  turns  out  that
this makes things much easier, and you can do better with std::condition_variable
_any  than  you  could  with  std::condition_variable.  Because  it  works  with  any  lock
type, you can build your own lock type that locks/unlocks both the internal set_clear
_mutex in your interrupt_flag and the lock supplied to the wait call, as shown here.

```cpp
Listing 9.12 interruptible_wait for std::condition_variable_any

class interrupt_flag
{
    std::atomic<bool> flag;
    std::condition_variable* thread_cond;
    std::condition_variable_any* thread_cond_any;
    std::mutex set_clear_mutex;
```

public:
    interrupt_flag():

        thread_cond(0),thread_cond_any(0)
```cpp
    {}
    void set()
    {
        flag.store(true,std::memory_order_relaxed);
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(set_clear_mutex);
        if(thread_cond)
        {
            thread_cond->notify_all();
        }
        else if(thread_cond_any)
        {
            thread_cond_any->notify_all();
        }
    }
    template<typename Lockable>
    void wait(std::condition_variable_any& cv,Lockable& lk)
    {
        struct custom_lock
        {
```

            interrupt_flag* self;
            Lockable& lk;
            custom_lock(interrupt_flag* self_,
```cpp
                        std::condition_variable_any& cond,
```

                        Lockable& lk_):
                self(self_),lk(lk_)
```cpp
            {
                self->set_clear_mutex.lock();
                self->thread_cond_any=&cond;
            }
            void unlock()
            {
                lk.unlock();
                self->set_clear_mutex.unlock();
            }
            void lock()
            {
                std::lock(self->set_clear_mutex,lk);
            }
            ~custom_lock()
            {
                self->thread_cond_any=0;
                self->set_clear_mutex.unlock();
            }
```

        };
```cpp
        custom_lock cl(this,cv,lk);
        interruption_point();
        cv.wait(cl);
        interruption_point();
    }
    // rest as before
```

};
```cpp
template<typename Lockable>
void interruptible_wait(std::condition_variable_any& cv,
```

                        Lockable& lk)

Interrupting threads

```cpp
{
    this_thread_interrupt_flag.wait(cv,lk);
}
```

Your custom lock type acquires the lock on the internal set_clear_mutex when it’s
constructed B, and then sets the thread_cond_any pointer to refer to the std:: con-
dition_variable_any  passed  in  to  the  constructor  c.  The  Lockable  reference  is
stored for later; this must already be locked. You can now check for an interruption
without worrying about races. If the interrupt flag is set at this point, it was set before
you  acquired  the  lock  on  set_clear_mutex.  When  the  condition  variable  calls  your
unlock()  function  inside  wait(),  you  unlock  the  Lockable  object  and  the  internal
set_clear_mutex d. This allows threads that are trying to interrupt you to acquire
the  lock  on  set_clear_mutex  and  check  the  thread_cond_any  pointer  once  you’re
inside the wait() call but not before. This is exactly what you were after (but couldn’t
```cpp
manage) with  std::condition_variable. Once  wait()  has  finished  waiting  (either
```

because it was notified or because of a spurious wake), it will call your lock() function, which again acquires the lock on the internal set_clear_mutex and the lock on
the  Lockable  object e.  You  can  now  check  again  for  interruptions  that  happened
during  the  wait()  call  before  clearing  the  thread_cond_any  pointer  in  your  cus-
tom_lock destructor f, where you also unlock the set_clear_mutex.

### 9.2.5 Interrupting other blocking calls

That rounds up interrupting condition variable waits, but what about other blocking
waits: mutex locks, waiting for futures, and the like? In general you have to go for the
timeout  option  you  used  for  std::condition_variable  because  there’s  no  way  to
interrupt the wait short of fulfilling the condition being waited for, without access to
the internals of the mutex or future. But with those other things, you do know what
you’re waiting for, so you can loop within the interruptible_wait() function. As an
example, here’s an overload of interruptible_wait() for std::future<>:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void interruptible_wait(std::future<T>& uf)
{
   while(!this_thread_interrupt_flag.is_set())
   {
       if(uf.wait_for(lk,std::chrono::milliseconds(1))==
           std::future_status::ready)
```

           break;
```cpp
   }
   interruption_point();
}
```

This waits until either the interrupt flag is set or the future is ready but does a blocking wait on the future for 1 ms at a time. This means that on average it will be around
## 0.5 ms before an interrupt request is acknowledged, assuming a high-resolution clock.

The wait_for will typically wait at least a whole clock tick, so if your clock ticks every

15 ms, you’ll end up waiting around 15 ms rather than 1 ms. This may or may not be
acceptable,  depending  on  the  circumstances.  You  can  always  reduce  the  timeout  if
necessary (and if the clock supports it). The downside of reducing the timeout is that
the  thread  will  wake  more  often  to  check  the  flag,  and  this  will  increase  the  taskswitching overhead.

  OK,  we’ve  looked  at  how  you  might  detect  interruption  with  the  interruption

_point() and interruptible_wait() functions, but how do you handle that?

### 9.2.6 Handling interruptions

From the point of view of the thread being interrupted, an interruption is a thread
_interrupted exception, which can therefore be handled like any other exception. In
particular, you can catch it in a standard catch block:

try
```cpp
{
    do_something();
}
catch(thread_interrupted&)
{
    handle_interruption();
}
```

This  means  that  you  could  catch  the  interruption,  handle  it  in  some  way,  and  then
carry on regardless. If you do this, and another thread calls interrupt() again, your
thread will be interrupted again the next time it calls an interruption point. You might
want to do this if your thread is performing a series of independent tasks; interrupting
one task will cause that task to be abandoned, and the thread can then move on to
performing the next task in the list.

 Because thread_interrupted is an exception, all the usual exception-safety precautions must also be taken when calling code that can be interrupted, in order to ensure
that resources aren’t leaked, and your data structures are left in a coherent state. Often,
it will be desirable to let the interruption terminate the thread, so you can let the exception  propagate  up.  But  if  you  let  exceptions  propagate  out  of  the  thread  function
passed  to  the  std::thread  constructor,  std::terminate()  will  be  called,  and  the
whole program will be terminated. In order to avoid having to remember to put a catch
(thread_interrupted) handler in every function you pass to interruptible_thread,
you  can  instead  put  that  catch  block  inside  the  wrapper  you  use  for  initializing  the
interrupt_flag.  This  makes  it  safe  to  allow  the  interruption  exception  to  propagate
unhandled, because it will then terminate that individual thread. The initialization of
the thread in the interruptible_thread constructor now looks like this:

```cpp
internal_thread=std::thread([f,&p]{
        p.set_value(&this_thread_interrupt_flag);
```

        try
```cpp
        {
            f();

Interrupting threads

        }
        catch(thread_interrupted const&)
        {}
    });
```

Let’s now look at a concrete example where interruption is useful.

### 9.2.7 Interrupting background tasks on application exit

Consider for a moment a desktop search application. As well as interacting with the
user,  the  application  needs  to  monitor  the  state  of  the  filesystem,  identifying  any
changes  and  updating  its  index.  This  processing  is  typically  left  to  a  background
thread  in  order  to  avoid  affecting  the  responsiveness  of  the  GUI.  This  background
thread needs to run for the entire lifetime of the application; it will be started as part
of the application initialization and left to run until the application is shut down. For
such an application this is typically only when the machine itself is being shut down,
because the application needs to run the whole time in order to maintain an up-todate index. In any case, when the application is being shut down, you need to close
down the background threads in an orderly manner; one way to do this is by interrupting them.

 The following listing shows a sample implementation of the thread-management

parts of this system.

Listing 9.13 Monitoring the filesystem in the background

B

```cpp
std::mutex config_mutex;
std::vector<interruptible_thread> background_threads;
void background_thread(int disk_id)
{
    while(true)
    {
        interruption_point();
        fs_change fsc=get_fs_changes(disk_id);
        if(fsc.has_changes())
        {
            update_index(fsc);
        }
    }
}
void start_background_processing()
{
    background_threads.push_back(
        interruptible_thread(background_thread,disk_1));
    background_threads.push_back(
        interruptible_thread(background_thread,disk_2));
}
int main()
{
    start_background_processing();
    process_gui_until_exit();
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(config_mutex);
```

e

- for(unsigned i=0;i<background_threads.size();++i)
```cpp
    {
        background_threads[i].interrupt();
    }
    for(unsigned i=0;i<background_threads.size();++i)
    {
        background_threads[i].join();
    }
}
```

g

h

At startup, the background threads are launched d. The main thread then proceeds
with handling the GUI e. When the user has requested that the application exit, the
background threads are interrupted f, and then the main thread waits for each background thread to complete before exiting g. The background threads sit in a loop,
checking for disk changes h and updating the index c. Every time around the loop
they check for interruption by calling interruption_point() B.

  Why  do  you  interrupt  all  the  threads  before  waiting  for  any?  Why  not  interrupt
each  and  then  wait  for  it  before  moving  on  to  the  next?  The  answer  is  concurrency.
Threads will likely not finish immediately when they’re interrupted, because they have
to  proceed  to  the  next  interruption  point  and  then  run  any  destructor  calls  and
exception-handling  code  necessary  before  they  exit.  By  joining  with  each  thread
immediately, you therefore cause the interrupting thread to wait, even though it still
has  useful  work  it  could  do—interrupt  the  other  threads.  Only  when  you  have  no
more work to do (all the threads have been interrupted) do you wait. This also allows
all the threads being interrupted to process their interruptions in parallel and potentially finish sooner.

 This interruption mechanism could easily be extended to add further interruptible calls or to disable interruptions across a specific block of code, but this is left as an
exercise for the reader.

### Summary

In  this  chapter,  we’ve  looked  at  various  advanced  thread-management  techniques:
thread pools and interrupting threads. You’ve seen how the use of local work queues
and work stealing can reduce the synchronization overhead and potentially improve
the throughput of the thread pool and how running other tasks from the queue while
waiting for a subtask to complete can eliminate the potential for deadlock.

 We’ve also looked at various ways of allowing one thread to interrupt the processing of another, such as the use of specific interruption points and functions that perform what would otherwise be a blocking wait in a way that can be interrupted.
